      "content_html": "\n2022 is about to end. It is that time when I say goodbye to one more year in my\nlife and welcome a new one. 2022 was a hectic year for me. Many of my decisions\nthis year will have rippling effects for years to come. But there was also a\ngood realization that I must take action; sitting idle won't help.\n\nAs always, I have divided this review into those areas of my life where I have\nbeen putting more focus throughout the year.\n\n# Health\n\n## Fitness\n\nI wish I had put more focus on my fitness this year. My sedentary lifestyle may\nput me at many health risks in years to come. My activity levels have been\nabysmally poor for most of the year. A big reason behind this was my busyness in\nother parts of my life. 2022 was an amalgamation of stress, fear, anxiety,\nsurprises, gratitude, and happiness. Fitness took a back seat due to the quick\nturnaround of events throughout the year. Early in the year, I continued with\nYoga. However, I was a lot more irregular this year because I wanted to gain\nmuscles while keeping my weight constant. So, I decided to join a gym in the\nsecond half of the year to focus on muscle building. However, due to the stress\nof wedding preparations, I couldn't find the motivation to continue beyond two\nmonths. There was one positive, though - whenever I committed to working out, I\ncould notice a boost of confidence spurting inside me. Unfortunately, I found it\nchallenging to maintain this motivation for long.\n\nI didn't have to suffer from any significant illness this year. I occasionally\nsuffered from slight back pain, which can be attributed to my poor posture.\nDoing Yoga keeps my back in shape, but whenever I stop doing Yoga, I start\nfeeling the pinch again in one or two months. This factor alone makes me realize\nthe importance of keeping my body active.\n\n## Sleep\n\nI managed to sleep around seven hours each day throughout the year. However,\nthis data doesn't include my afternoon naps, so my daily sleep duration is\nundoubtedly higher than 7 hours. Sleeping in the afternoons has become a habit\nthat I never intended to develop. But now, it has become a permanent fixture in\nmy life. In 2023, I plan to keep my tendency to sleep in the afternoon in\ncontrol, but that will require sleeping enough at night, without which all my\nefforts will remain useless.\n\n![Sleeping in 2022](/images/posts/2022_average_sleep_duration.png \"How much I slept in 2022?\")\n\nI slept the least in June, which is surprising. I was expecting it to be in\nJuly, August, and September when I was in the midst of my courtship period.\n\nI would have liked to put a graph showing my sleep and wake-up times as well,\nbut my graph plotting skills require some polishing, so for now, I will stop\nhere. Someday, I would like to analyze that data as well.\n\n# Career\n\n## Netskope\n\nJoining Netskope was a good decision for my career. While I learned a lot at\nCisco, my experience at Netskope has been different. This year, after seeing the\nturbulent market conditions, I kept on wondering if joining Netskope was a\nfinancially prudent decision. If I keep this fact aside, my experience at\nNetskope has been good.\n\n## Learning\n\nI have not been able to keep up with emerging technologies in the last two-three\nyears. While my basics are solid, I should invest some time in learning new\ntrends to stay relevant and employable in the future. The tech industry can be\nfierce at times. With all the turmoil in the world, it becomes even more\nimportant to keep myself updated. For the last four years, I have been lacking\nin learning new things (irrespective of their connection to my work). That may\nhave put me behind my peers by a few years. Whenever I see my peers racing ahead\nof me, I feel disappointed. I know that becoming part of this rat race will only\ngive me grief, but as a human, I am not immune to these emotions. However, I am\nvery well aware that taking action is the only way to come back on track.\n\n## Future\n\nFor the first time in the last three years, I feel clarity in my thoughts about\nmy future direction, which may be a good sign. Going into 2023, this clarity can\nprove miraculous for my career and personal life. I hope it is the case.\n\n# Writing\n\n## The Problem\n\nWriting regularly was one of my primary goals this year. For the last couple of\nyears, I have been struggling with some mental block when it comes to writing.\nIt turns out that the problem was the lack of content. I either did not have\nanything to write about, or needed to try harder to gather the material, or\nprocrastinated. I wrote less this year too, but I could get into the flow\nwhenever I wanted to.\n\n## Journaling\n\nBlogging was not a priority this year. However, journaling has proven to be a\nwonderful experience for me this year. More so, it gave me a window into my\nthought process when making the most critical decision of my life - whether to\nmarry or not. I wrote extensively around that time about what I was thinking,\nwhat I liked in her, and what I didn't. When I reread those entries, it\nimmediately brings a smile to my face. Such has been the impact of journaling on\nme. I plan to write many more journal entries next year. I hope these new\nentries will also bring a smile to my face in the distant future.\n\n## Hobby\n\nI have a long-term wish to start a newsletter and grow my audience, but I wonder\nif I am ready to put in the effort required for this task at this moment. Also,\nI need to be more confident about whether I have good content/topic to write\nabout. Since I still hesitate to share my blog posts on social media, starting\nand growing a newsletter will be an uphill task.\n\nGetting committed this year meant that I finally had some inspiration to engage\nwith creative writing. And I thoroughly enjoyed writing for someone else. In the\nlast seven years since I started writing, I have never tried to write in Hindi.\nBut after doing it this year, I realized that I enjoy writing in Hindi. I plan\nto continue this (even if sporadically) in 2023.\n\n# Reading\n\n## The failure\n\nI have a feeling of disappointment while writing this section. I decided to read\n24 books this year. I am ending it without reading a single book. Throughout the\nyear, I could not make up my mind about reading. A significant reason behind\nthis was the double thoughts in my mind about the objective for which I was\nreading and whether I could retain whatever I was reading. I found myself\nstruggling to come to terms with the fact that no matter what I do, I will never\nbe able to recall everything I read. This realization was the root cause behind\nmy disillusion with reading. Unfortunately, I still need to find a definite\nanswer to this dilemma. However, I can still restart my reading journey with\nfiction books, as I don't see the need to remember such books.\n\n## But...\n\nHaving said this, it is not that I didn't read anything at all. I managed to\nread the first three modules of Zerodha's varsity content. These modules are\nsuch a valuable source to learn about the markets. I thoroughly enjoyed reading\nthem. Unfortunately, at least this year, I didn't use the knowledge gathered. To\nstart with the stock market again, I may have to reread the modules to recall\nthe concepts (this is one example of the issues I mentioned in the previous\nparagraph).\n\n# Media Consumption\n\n## Bingeing\n\nOne side effect of not reading enough books was that my mind tried to find other\navenues to pass the time. In the first half of the year, I took refuge in movies\nand TV series to relieve myself from day-to-day life. I watched 22 films and\nthree web series in the year's first half. Before getting married, I watched\nonly two movies between July and November. After getting married, in December, I\nwatched five movies.\n\n| **Name**                                                       | **Type** | **Month** | **Rating** |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ---------- |\n| Loki                                                           | Show     | January   | 7          |\n| Eternals                                                       | Movie    | January   | 6          |\n| Pushpa: The Rise - Part 1                                      | Movie    | January   | 7          |\n| What If…                                                       | Show     | January   | 8          |\n| Kingsman: The Golden Circle                                    | Movie    | February  | 8          |\n| The King's Man                                                 | Movie    | February  | 6          |\n| Mortal Kombat                                                  | Movie    | February  | 4          |\n| Rudra                                                          | Show     | March     | 7          |\n| Spider-Man: No Way Home                                        | Movie    | March     | 8          |\n| Bell Bottom                                                    | Movie    | March     | 5          |\n| Wanted                                                         | Movie    | March     | 4          |\n| Housefull 4                                                    | Movie    | March     | 2          |\n| Dasvi                                                          | Movie    | April     | 7          |\n| National Treasure                                              | Movie    | April     | 7          |\n| Badhaai Do                                                     | Movie    | April     | 6          |\n| National Treasure: Book of Secrets                             | Movie    | April     | 6          |\n| The Batman                                                     | Movie    | April     | 9          |\n| Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl         | Movie    | May       | 8          |\n| Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest                     | Movie    | May       | 7          |\n| The Lost City                                                  | Movie    | May       | 3          |\n| The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe | Movie    | May       | 8          |\n| The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian                       | Movie    | May       | 8          |\n| The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader       | Movie    | May       | 9          |\n| K.G.F: Chapter 2                                               | Movie    | May       | 7          |\n| Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness                    | Movie    | June      | 8          |\n| Brahmāstra Part One: Shiva                                     | Movie    | September | 7          |\n| Thor: Love and Thunder                                         | Movie    | October   | 7          |\n| Doctor G                                                       | Movie    | December  | 7          |\n| Cirkus                                                         | Movie    | December  | 5          |\n| Govinda Naam Mera                                              | Movie    | December  | 6          |\n| Encanto                                                        | Movie    | December  | 7          |\n| The Dictator                                                   | Movie    | December  | 6          |\n\n## Social Media\n\nI was in control of my social media usage in the first half of the year, but\nInstagram caught me off guard after that. I have never been a fan of Instagram,\nbut this year, circumstances forced me to get into the rabbit hole. Currently, I\nhave managed to control my Instagram usage. Still, I need to keep my eyes open\nto avoid any addiction.\n\n## Phone\n\nI don't have my phone usage data, but I am sure it has skyrocketed this year.\nSince July, I have managed to use my phone for more than 6 hours every day on a\nroutine basis. I must figure out how to reduce this usage and focus on more\nimportant things.\n\n# Family\n\n## Back to Office\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, I have been staying with my family. It has\nbeen three years, and with each passing day, I feel uncomfortable even thinking\nabout moving back to Bengaluru. With the feeling of belongingness combined with\nthe mess that Bengaluru is in, I find myself resisting moving back to Bengaluru,\nat least in the near future. My employer supports remote work, which gives me\nhope that I can spend a few more months here in Jaipur. Staying in Jaipur has\nobvious monetary benefits, but I see long-term hindrances in career growth. I\nmay have to find a middle path to avoid stagnating in my career and satisfy my\nemotional cravings towards my family.\n\n## Fam\n\nOn the family front, this year has been incredible. Several long-term wishes of\nmy family got fulfilled this year. My mother came back home after a successful\nrecovery from a severe ailment. We shifted to a new house. I got married. My\nbrother got a government job. What else could I have asked for?\n\n## Vishi\n\nAs the latest entrant into my family, she has been a welcome addition. When 2022\nstarted, the idea of getting married was completely absent from my mind. There\nwere other _more_ _important_ stuff in my life that required immediate\nattention. But life had its plans. And I am glad that life had its way. Though I\nwas not rooting to get married, I found a person with whom my thoughts match. I\nhave not been a people-friendly person in my personal life, so it will take some\ntime to adjust to another person's presence. Still, the way we have spent the\nlast five months together, this will be a fun journey together.\n\n# What in 2023?\n\nMy experience says I could improve following up with my new year's resolutions.\nHowever, that is not going to stop me from resoluting some more goals this year\nas well. Even if I don't achieve any of these, they will linger around in the\nback of my mind and remind me to take at least one step toward them.\n\n## Fitness\n\nI don't know of any method to quantify my fitness progress, but I aim to keep my\nweight under 65 kgs while transferring some of my weight from fat to muscles.\n\n## Reading\n\nI have decided to read **at least** 24 books (2 books per month) this year. A\ncombination of fiction, non-fiction, Hindi, and technical books would be ideal\nand help me avoid the sudden lack of interest. You can track my progress\n[here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63354397-yash).\n\n## Writing\n\nSome journal entries, [FutureMe](https://www.futureme.org) letters, and a few\nblog posts should be enough for this year. I am writing more than ever\nprivately, but as a side effect, public writing has taken a back seat for now. I\nwill write on this blog whenever I have something important to share.\n\nI enjoyed journaling in 2022, so this is also high on my priority list for 2023.\nI intend to write only sometimes, but doing it once in a while - on important\nevents of my life - should be doable.\n\n## Travel\n\nNow that I have a partner-in-crime, I plan to travel extensively (while keeping\nfinancial and professional commitments in mind). The resurge of COVID is\nthreatening to spoil one of my trips early next year, so I also need to keep an\neye on that. However, I will travel as and when possible. Expect some travelogue\nposts on this blog in the near future.\n\n---\n\n2022 was a good year for me. I achieved many goals this year. After a long time,\nI have some clarity in my mind about my future course of action. I hope to\nexecute some (or all) of my plans in 2023.\n\nThis year taught me a vital lesson - every time you plan something, there will\nbe a lot of apprehensions. All it takes to proceed further is to take one step.\nEverything else automatically falls into place.\n\nThank you, 2022, for this critical lesson. Adios, I will never forget you for\nbringing so many new memories into my life.\n\nAnd welcome to you, 2023!!!\n",

      "content_html": "\nLife sometimes takes such unexpected turns that we humans can only stand still\nand wonder. That's what happened to me. Just two months back, I was urging my\nfather to stop talking to me about my marriage plans, and here I am today,\nannouncing my engagement. It is how the sequence of events has been in my life\nin the last two months. However, I am not at all troubled with all these sudden\nturns and twists.\n\nComing to the topic of the discussion, the name of my fiancée is Vishakha. Our\nroka-cum-engagement ceremony took place on 30th of July. We exchanged rings\nbefore a small family gathering and had our first pooja together. Now, we are\nofficially in our courtship period. We both belong to slightly different\neducational backgrounds and academic interests. However, that doesn't seem to be\na barrier between us, and we share many views about life, family, society, and\nother things in general.\n\nI have been timid in talking to strangers, but right from our first meeting, I\nstruck a strange connection with her. Our first meeting lasted for around one\nand a half hours, which astonished our families, given that she and I don't talk\nmuch, even among family members. Since then, we have spoken for uncountable\nhours, discussing our priorities, ambitions, goals, thoughts about life, likes,\ndislikes, etc.\n\nIt may be initial excitement or infatuation, but I can feel the emotions of care\nand love blossoming in me. These are some unfamiliar emotions for me. I have\nnever attached to any human being other than my parents. Now having the same\nfeelings for a stranger is difficult to digest. I don't know if love can blossom\nso quickly. But if it does, then I am definitely in love. And if it doesn't, it\nwill happen soon.\n\nWhen I broke the news on Instagram, many people asked me one question - Why so\nearly? While there were no particular reasons behind my decision, in retrospect,\nI think this was an excellent decision to take at this juncture of my life.\n\n1. I am currently stagnating in my life and career. I am going through that\n   phase where I don't see any yield of my work on both personal and\n   professional fronts. Although I am confident that I will reap the results of\n   this work in the future, the present appears to be the best time to welcome\n   another person into my life. I hope her entry into my life and the resultant\n   influence will help me come out of this slump phase. I must mention that this\n   is a double-edged sword, and I am taking a huge risk here. But that is\n   something only time will tell.\n2. My parents would have started forcing me to get married in the next year or\n   two. I preferred not to juggle between Bengaluru (or elsewhere) and Jaipur,\n   hoping to find a match. I have seen my cousins struggling with that.\n3. I had planned to go for a corporate-sponsored graduate program. But then I\n   left Cisco, and since Netskope doesn't have any such program; I had to put\n   this plan on hold for a couple of years. So, I am relatively free at this\n   point in my life. I believe there couldn't have been a better time to hook up\n   than this.\n4. After the pandemic began, I came back to my hometown. Since then, my life has\n   become highly monotonous, and I was looking for some respite from it. I was\n   feeling the need for another person in my life who could push me out of my\n   comfort zone while also respecting my boundaries.\n5. Perhaps I was also looking for lady luck.\n\n![Vishi and Yash](/images/posts/vishi_and_yash.jpg \"Vishi and Yash\")\n\nMarrying means leaving your bachelorhood behind, and that has its downsides.\n\n1. Time spent on your family means you can't spend time on your career and other\n   outside-of-work activities. But I think, at some point, I had to find a\n   balance anyway.\n2. The responsibility to maintain a family is not an easy one. It comes with its\n   challenges. Bachelorhood is relatively easy; you are on your own. But in\n   married life, someone else is looking up to you for constant support,\n   dedication, and love. I wonder how long it will take me to adjust to this.\n3. Your goals and ambitions are not only yours anymore. They get shared with\n   your spouse. And if the spouse is not supportive, life can take a downturn\n   quickly.\n4. You can't just think about yourself selfishly. You need to consider the\n   effect of every decision of yours on your spouse as well. It can get clumsy\n   sometimes.\n\nAs usual, I have spoiled this post by talking about ups and downs 🤣. My habit\nof weighing everything in pros and cons will not die so quickly 🤓. But I want\nto clarify one thing: I am thrilled and content with my decision.\n\nI am looking forward to this alliance and spending more time getting to know\nVishi 💗. I hope I will be a worthy partner to her.\n",

      "content_html": "\n**Note:** This post was originally written on Jan 29, 2022 but I never posted\nit. Posting it now keeping the original authoring date, but with commit date of\nAug 05, 2022.\n\nThis post was on my bucket list for almost one year, but I kept ignoring it for\none or another reason. Anyway, I wanted to write this post to add my experience\nto several other interview experiences to help others. Another intention was to\ndocument this experience for my own consumption in the future to relive one of\nthe greatest moments in my life and career without worrying about diminishing\nmemory.\n\nI had decided to take the ISRO exam as part of my GATE preparation strategy. The\npaper was apparently very lengthy and came with time-consuming calculations.\nWith some difficulty, I could solve a fair number of questions. Then, I forgot\nabout this and started focusing on my GATE preparation again. The GATE journey\nis also memorable, which I may describe in a future post. While I was waiting\nfor results for both ISRO and GATE, the pandemic hit the country, and I made a\nquick jump back to my hometown. The pandemic also delayed the ISRO results. But\nwhen it was announced, it was a surprise for me. I was selected for further\ninterview rounds. Then, a long wait ensued. I had to wait till February 2021 to\nget an interview call. I attended the interview for the post of 'Scientist' in\nISRO on March 4, 2021, in New Delhi.\n\nI had been part of very few interviews in my life until ISRO's interview. I\ncould count them on fingers -\n\n1. SSL admin interview at NITC (which I rocked :P)\n2. The Directi interview (where I reached till last round), and\n3. The Cisco interview (I rocked this one too).\n\nI haven't been part of any other interview in my life, so far. So, I am notably\nless experienced in giving interviews. But, unlike other fields in my life, I\nhave never felt nervous while giving interviews. I am not yet sure of the exact\nreasons behind this confidence. Perhaps, I am not an introvert as I think I am.\n\nAnyway, the decision to attend or not attend the interview was tough. There were\nmany reasons -\n\n1. What if I get selected for the interviews! The pressure to join ISRO will be\n   enormous.\n2. What if I get COVID during the journey or stay in New Delhi!\n3. If I am not interested in joining ISRO, why should I waste money on travel\n   and accommodation!\n\nMy parents didn't know that I had taken the ISRO exam. So, it was a pleasant\nsurprise for them. I decided to attend the interviews because my parents looked\necstatic about this opportunity. My brother accompanied me to Delhi; we stayed\nin a nice hotel, ate good food, and visited some excellent locations in Delhi\ntogether.\n\nComing to the primary purpose of this post, how was my interview experience?\nWell, it was a mixed bag. I wasn't satisfied with some of my answers, but I\ncould feel that the interview panel liked my answers. Like all other interviews\nI have given, this interview revolved mostly around Linux, Networking, OS, and\nSecurity. One good thing about ISRO interviews is that ask your preferred\nsubjects before starting the discussion. I said that my favorite subjects are\nOS, Security, and Networking. They did ask me why I don't like DBMS. I told them\nthat I had never worked with DBs until now, so I am not very familiar with its\npractical aspects. After that, they asked me questions from my preferred domains\nonly. As expected, I had absolutely no issues answering most of the questions\naccurately. There were some tricky questions where they tried to stress-test me,\nbut I was able to deflect them.\n\nAlthough I had to be physically present at the ISRO center, the actual interview\nhappened virtually on Cisco WebEx (!).\n\nBelow is an inaccurate version of the converstaion -\n\n**Interview Panel (IP):** Please introduce yourself.\n\n**Me:** Introduced myself. The panel specifically asked about my graduation\ndetails and final project details.\n\n**IP:** So, you work in Cisco. What are you doing there?\n\n**Me:** Explained my work in Snort and FTD team\n\n**IP:** What purpose does FTD serve?\n\n**Me:** Explained in brief, as I had just joined the FTD team at that time.\n\n**IP:** We are using FTDs in ISRO. It is giving us too many issues. How do we\nfix it?\n\n**Me:** Suggested some solutions, including Hardware and Software ones. They\ntried to stress-test me on this. Thankfully I didn't lose my patience and kept\ngiving them some answers.\n\n**IP:** What happens behind the scenes when you type a web address in the\nbrowser?\n\n**Me:** Explained\n\n**IP:** How does the router know where to forward the packet?\n\n**Me:** I fumbled a bit on this one because I did make a mistake in the previous\nquestion. Anyway answered it correctly in the end.\n\n**IP:** What is page fault and context switch? Does a page fault require a\ncontext switch?\n\n**Me:** Answered. Don't remember the answer now. It is very clearly explained in\nOSTEP.\n\n**IP:** How is kernel mode switched?\n\n**Me:** Explained\n\n**IP:** What is a trap? What does the trap handler do? How is it invoked?\n\n**Me:** Explained\n\n**IP:** Explain Linux File Permissions? How to interpret directory 555 and file\n777 permissions?\n\n**Me:** Explained\n\n**IP:** Do you know about the security of OS?\n\n**Me:** Explained some concepts. I mentioned Linux Hardening, then they asked\nmany questions on the overall idea of hardening of the OS.\n\n**IP:** How to modify a Kernel to work with resource-constrained devices?\n\n**Me:** I explained some modifications, like removing unnecessary drivers and\nblobs used for generic purposes, etc.\n\n**IP:** What is a TCP wrapper? Do you know about Netstat?\n\n**Me:** I didn't know about TCP wrappers, so I said I don't know. Explained\nNetstat briefly.\n\n**IP:** How can we improve the security of an OS?\n\n**Me:** I explained some ways to secure OS connected to a network by installing\nsome tools and firewalls, like Fail2Ban, FTDs, UFW, etc. They were expecting\nIPTables, so they asked about it next.\n\n**IP:** What are IPTables? Do you know about chains in IPTables?\n\n**Me:** I explained IPTables, but couldn't answer the concept of chains.\n\n**IP:** Explain some common web attacks?\n\n**Me:** I explained OWASP Top 10 and a few attacks like SQL Injection, XSS, etc.\n\n**IP:** Which attacks are possible in an OS?\n\n**Me:** Explained buffer overflow, heap overflow, stack smashing, etc.\n\nIn the end, they asked some general questions about Linux Kernel, which I don't\nremember now. Then they concluded the interview and asked me to leave. The\ninterview took around 30-45 minutes. The discussion entirely revolved around the\nsystems side of things, which worked in my favor.\n\nI analyzed my performance after the interview. There were some things that I\nwould like to fix in the future.\n\n1. While preparing for GATE, I didn't focus on making notes. Having short notes\n   helps at the last moment. I suffered because I had to go through the entire\n   syllabus again, even for a quick revision.\n2. I have improved my communication skills significantly, but they are still not\n   up to the mark. My inherently introverted nature keeps pulling me back.\n   During this interview, I fumbled quite a bit. It may be that seeing myself on\n   camera on screen made me self-conscious. Still, I need to work on this aspect\n   of my soft skills because I am sure that I will need to use communication\n   skills a lot in the coming future.\n3. My knowledge of Linux, Networking, and OS is invaluable. I need to make sure\n   that I don't neglect them in the future and keep myself up to date with the\n   latest trends in the field.\n4. I severely lack focus and motivation. Even during the interview, I faced\n   issues with focusing on the questions. My mind keeps on having distracting\n   thoughts. I need to find some ways to improve my focus significantly.\n   Otherwise, my mind will lose its capabilities even faster with growing age.\n5. My understanding of Cisco products is severely limited. I spent three years\n   in Cisco. Still, I don't know much about any Cisco product lines completely.\n   I don't even know about all Cisco's Security unit's products, even after\n   spending my entire 3 years there. This is a difficult situation.\n   Unfortunately, now that I have left Cisco, there is no way/reason to get that\n   understanding.\n\nThe results came in September 2021, and to my surprise, I was selected for the\npost with AIR 30. My final marks in the written exam were 110/216 (some\nquestions were canceled), and I scored 83.18/100 in interviews. However, I\ndecided not to join ISRO because the center assigned to me didn't align with my\ninterests and other reasons that I mentioned in a\n[separate post](/blog/why-i-decided-to-not-join-isro/). My parents were\ndelighted with my achievement; however, they supported my decision not to join\nISRO.\n\nAugust 2018 to February 2020 was a very frustrating yet fruitful phase of my\nlife. The knowledge I acquired during this time helped me overcome my self-doubt\ndue to my failures in academics in NITC. Getting selected for ISRO made the\nentire process memorable in the end. I will always cherish this achievement of\nmine.\n",

      "content_html": "\n**Note:** This post was originally written on Jan 26, 2022 but I never posted\nit. Posting it now keeping the original authoring date, but with commit date of\nAug 05, 2022.\n\nSometimes, life presents you with some choices that it becomes tricky to choose\nany one of them. Last year, my turn came when I was selected for a prestigious\njob at Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). I was chosen for the post of\nScientist in the organization. The pay was top notch with the pay grade\nequivalent to that of new bureaucrats. The pride that comes with the service to\nthe nation was also associated with the job. I could have enjoyed my life\nwithout any worry about layoffs, pay cuts, workload, always having to learn new\nthings, etc. But I decided to leave the offer and continue with what I was\ndoing.\n\nWhy did I do that? Was I mad? It has been almost one year since my final\ninterview and nearly 3 months since I declined the offer. In this post, I intend\nto publicize my reasons for not joining ISRO. You may or may not agree with a\nlot of these reasons (even I doubt some of my decisions), but don't hesitate to\nvoice your opinion. Perhaps, it will give me another perspective to think about\nsimilar situations in the future.\n\n## The job profile and assigned ISRO center\n\nI studied Computer Science during my undergraduate and have been working in the\nsoftware industry since then. I know I can learn any new field (aerospace\nengineering, in this case) if I want to. Still, it was not a financially\nlucrative choice, and also it was not in alignment with my interests.\n\nI was assigned to NRSC, Hyderabad, which would be my base for the rest of my\ncareer. NRSC stands for National Remote Sensing Center. As I understand it, the\nNRSC primarily works on analyzing the images and media received from various\nISRO satellites. I have never been an enthusiast of the field of computer vision\nand image processing (perhaps because of the maths associated with it). So I\nwasn't very keen on doing something which does not align with my current\ninterests. Although, one can say that you start loving anything if given enough\ntime. But I wasn't very sure about taking chances.\n\nOf course, I queried about the possibilities of transfer to some other center. I\nwas told that the chances of a transfer are slim unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances or a mutual transfer.\n\n## The location\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, if I had accepted the offer, I would have been bound to\nHyderabad for the rest of my career. This was totally unacceptable to me. Many\nthings have changed globally since the pandemic started, and the work location\nflexibility is one of the positive changes. Earlier, it was challenging to work\nfrom home, but now, it is/will be accepted as an industry norm. ISRO, being a\ngovernment organization and from a national security perspective, will not allow\nits employees to work from home, rightly so. At present, I would perhaps be okay\nwith the idea of exploring the world and staying away from the family. Still, I\nwould like to settle down at some familiar place in the longer run. Joining ISRO\nwould have stolen that possibility from me ultimately, if not immediately.\n\nI have been staying at my home for the last 2 years due to COVID lockdowns. This\nhas affected my psyche at a deep level. I no longer wish to stay away from my\nparents. The detachment caused by my 7 year-long explorations ended with COVID\nlockdown. It will be tough for me to stay away from them for any long duration\nnow. Air travel has reduced the distances drastically, but the possibility of a\nWFH-friendly future has spoiled me. ISRO is unlikely to provide this kind of\noption in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Money\n\nMoney always plays a part in every decision a working adult takes. While the\nstarting salary given by ISRO is comparable to private sector companies, the\nyearly increments are peanuts. One gets 18% conditional increment + possible\npromotions every four years, which looks terrible compared to MNCs. Although\njoining ISRO comes with certain other perks which will definitely match or even\noutshine the overall CTC offered by MNCs in some cases.\n\nSuppose I had decided to join ISRO in an alternate universe. In that case, I\ncould have given you a lot of reasons why money should not be a factor in\ndeciding whether to take the job or not. So, I will stop discussing the\nimportance of money in a job offer here.\n\n## Not my kind of government job\n\nGovernment jobs are lucrative in India. They pay decent, have excellent perks,\ngive life-long job security, and calm and peaceful life on most days. However,\nyou can divide the government jobs into three categories -\n\n1. Those with power, status, money, meaningful work, and hectic life\n2. Those with meaningful work, money, and peaceful life but no power and status\n3. Those with peaceful life (?), nothing else\n\nIn my opinion, ISRO's job falls into category 2, where you have good work,\nmoney, and life but no power or status. I have good work and money in the\nprivate sector (life is a hit or miss). So, I couldn't find any reason good\nenough to join ISRO. If I had the option to choose a job from category 1 (for\nexample, all India services), I wouldn't have given a second thought to the\nidea. My current thinking is that if I have to live someplace other than my\nhometown, I would like to have either big money or power and social status.\n\n## It wasn't my original target\n\nI attempted the ISRO exam to get some additional practice for the GATE exam. I\nhad plans to get into some good colleges (IISc!) for further studies. ISRO's\nexam format coincides very much with the GATE's. So I thought that it would be\nan excellent opportunity to get some much-needed real exam experience. There was\nno other aspect to this fact. If I had taken the exam intending to join ISRO on\nselection, it would have been effortless to convince myself. But, in my\nscenario, I could not convince myself about the opportunity. Some may say that\nnot everybody gets this opportunity, and I should have accepted it happily. I am\nsorry, but I don't subscribe to this viewpoint. I understand that the gods were\nkind enough to provide me with this opportunity. But I firmly believe that the\nsame gods would also appreciate my reasoning about the decision to decline the\noffer.\n\nFor some people, these reasons may seem non-important. My personal circumstances\nand professional ambitions, and my self-confidence (perhaps over-confidence)\ncontributed to my final decision to decline the ISRO offer. It is very much\npossible that I may regret this decision in the future when my life takes a\ndownturn. I hope that this post will remind me of my present situation and bring\nme out of my grief. The decision taken is what matters now. I should focus on\nthe next minute, hour, day, month, and years to come.\n\nWish me luck 🍀\n",

Posting it now keeping the original authoring date, but with commit date of\nAug 05, 2022.\n\nAfter three years at Cisco, I finally decided to explore other opportunities\nin 2021. 22/01/2022 was my last day in Cisco. It has been an exhilarating\njourney. Even more so because it was my first such journey. I thoroughly enjoyed\nmy time at Cisco, both professionally and personally.\n\nCisco provided me ample chances to work on a variety of problems. I started in a\ntotally independent role exploring various open-source products and developing\nPOCs integrating multiple open-source tools to the Cisco product line. I worked\nwith OPA, ModSecurity, OpenRASP, etc. along with evaluation of Signal Sciences,\nK2 etc. We also worked on identifying differences between Snort's http module\nand ModSecurity, apart from developing POCs to identify supply chain attacks by\nevaluating the build artefacts generated in a CI pipeline.\n\nLater I got a chance to work with a typical product development team when I\nswitched to Snort team where I worked on the FTD integration for Snort, and\nhelped in shipping high-quality code enhancing legacy Cisco firewalls. I also\ngot an opportunity to contribute to some significant components to the very\nearly stage Secure Firewall Cloud Native (SFCN) – Cisco's own cloud-based\nsecurity solution – where I introduced an important component required for\nhealth monitoring in the SFCN clusters. Throughout my tenure at Cisco, I got\nopportunities to work on both the legacy (Lina ASA - a 20-year-old product) and\nthe latest tools and technologies – Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Prometheus\netc.\n\nBut, work was not the best thing about Cisco. The work was, of course,\nexcellent, but what makes Cisco a dream company for many is its people. The\nculture that Cisco imbibes is pure gold. I don't know how the rest of the\nindustry operates in this department, simply because of my inexperience. But for\na novice like me, Cisco provided an ideal launchpad. I have many regrets about\nmy time at Cisco, more on this later in the post. The people I met and worked\nwith throughout my time in Cisco were exceptional in their work and, at the same\ntime, were quite humble and down to earth in their dealings with me. I have also\nheard about some bad experiences from people working in Cisco, so I may have\nbeen fortunate in this aspect. Exceptions are everywhere, but they should not be\nthe norm. And the toxicity is definitely not the norm in Cisco.\n\nWhile I learned a lot of things in Cisco, there were a lot of opportunities that\nI didn't utilize while in Cisco. There used to be many hackathons, patentothons,\ncultural, literary, technical clubs, and sporting facilities in Cisco. Many of\nmy friends were part of these activities, and some even led the organizing teams\nof these event. I never tried to contribute to any of these events. I had some\npersonal and professional reasons behind this lack of enthusiasm. One of my\ncolleagues criticized me **privately** for this on my last day - \"Yash, I wish\nyou had shown more involvement during the team building activities.\" I have been\nan introvert throughout my life, and changing one's personality is not easy. But\nthis is something I will actively try to avoid repeating.\n\nNow, you may ask, if everything was so rosy about Cisco, why did you leave,\nYash?\n\nWell, the reasons are many folded -\n\n1. I am only 25. It is not a time to settle for me.\n2. I was trying to break away from the traditional network security domain. I\n   have been interested in distributed systems and cloud security. Still, my\n   current team was not an ideal place for this. Switching to some other team\n   inside Cisco was an option. But I decided to explore the industry from\n   another perspective by changing the company.\n3. Few more reasons that are not as important to mention here.\n\nAnyway, Cisco will always have a special place in my heart for introducing me to\nthe corporate world.\n\nIt is farewell for now. Au Revoir, Cisco!\n",

      "content_html": "\n2021 was a year of realigning priorities for me. I started the year with a set\nof goals, expectations, and an enthusiasm to achieve these, and here I am,\nending the year with entirely different objectives and perspectives. There were\na few ups and downs throughout the year, but collectively, these have\ntransformed me into a more fitter, confident, enthusiastic, and curious version\nof my past self.\n\n## Health\n\nIf you read this blog regularly, you may know that I have been struggling to\nmake health a priority in my life for the last few years. This year also started\non the same note. I started with 65 kgs of weight, and by the end of July, my\nweight had increased to 71 kgs. I have been underweight for most of my life, but\nI probably became obese for the first time on the BMI scale this year. And I am\nnot very proud of this, even though I always desired to gain some weight while\ngrowing up. I have long realized the importance of exercise in daily life but\nnever acted on it seriously.\n\nNonetheless, this year I finally managed to work on it. Since September, I have\nreduced my weight from 71 kgs to 62 kgs. More importantly, I could bring my BMI\ndown to an optimum level.\n\nAnother important aspect of health that I am working on is sleep. For some years\nnow, I have been working on regulating my sleep timings and the time I spend\nsleeping at night. I have data about my sleep duration for the entire year.\nUsing that, I produced the chart below, which shows that I have managed to sleep\nat least 8 hours on average (this also includes afternoon naps).\n\n![Sleeping in 2021](/images/posts/2021_average_sleep_duration.png \"Sleeping in 2021\")\n\nOne of my last year's goals was -\n\nI feel that I have managed to achieve this goal with a good level of accuracy.\n\n## Career\n\nThis year, I completed three years in Cisco. It has been a wonderful experience.\nHowever, I had a feeling that I should move on and start exploring the industry\nfrom a different perspective. So, I decided to go back to the interview table.\nIn 2022, I will be joining a late-stage US-based cloud-security startup. I will\nwrite a separate post describing my experience preparing and attending the\ninterviews.\n\nI had to make a rather tough decision about my career this year. When I was\npreparing for GATE, I also decided to take the ISRO exam. The idea was to get\nsome additional practice from the GATE perspective. After clearing the written\ntest and the interviews, I got an all-India rank of 30 in the exam. As a result,\nI was offered a Group-A post of Scientist in NRSC Hyderabad. However, it didn't\nalign with my vision and plans for the future, so I decided to decline the\noffer. I hope to write a long-overdue post about my experience with this\nsometime in 2022.\n\n## Blogging and Writing\n\nThe fact that I could not post this review on the first day of the year is a\ntestament that I am struggling with writing. I am not in the proper mindset to\nwrite anything. I have tried to start small, but writing even a single sentence\nseems like a burden. Throughout 2021, I had a nagging feeling that I should\nwrite, but I couldn't find the enthusiasm to sit down and get going.\nUnfortunately, I don't even see myself writing anytime in the foreseeable\nfuture.\n\nI notice that the procedure used to publish anything on this blog is very\ncomplex. Unlike WordPress, I have to battle with markdown, git, code editor,\netc., to publish a post and make subsequent updates. The complexity associated\nwith the static sites seems to have created a block in my mind. Unfortunately,\ndeveloping a new website is no longer a priority for me. And I am not yet ready\nto accept the tradeoff between spending money on WordPress hosting and the\ncomfort of writing in Wordpress's editor.\n\nI planned to journal regularly in 2021. I started with that, but soon it turned\ninto a logbook kind of activity. Instead of introspecting over my day, I started\ntracking each hour of the day, which was not the intention. So around July, I\nstopped doing it.\n\n## Reading\n\nI had set a target to read five books this year. I completed that goal. I read a\nlot of PDFs this year, which can't be classified as books, so my reading\nstatistics are very much skewed for the year. However, I didn't plan properly\nthis year, so my efforts seem scattered and unfocused.\n\nTo be very honest, I was distracted throughout the year by the continuous\nflooding of information. My tendency to do everything with perfection further\nmade things complicated. Another troubling issue was my resistance to making\nnotes or summarising the books I read. I consider this an important activity\nbecause I find it challenging to recall otherwise.\n\nI dabbled with Zettlekasten for some time this year. It is an exciting idea, but\nthe time required to set it up is a big hurdle. It takes considerable effort to\nsummarise a piece of knowledge, link it with other information, and then revise\nall of it. I may not be ready for it yet, but I will be trying it again in 2022\nbecause I am very confident about the potential of this system.\n\nI have reduced (or stopped) my Twitter usage to minimize information overload. I\nfelt that passively reading others' views distorts my thinking and ability to\ngenerate original ideas. Although I am not really producing any exciting ideas,\nI want to keep my mind clean and free from distraction as much as possible.\n\n## Media Consumption\n\nI logged my sleep data, work schedules, perceived productivity levels, perceived\nsleep efficiency, mobile usage patterns, etc., in a Google Sheet document.\nHowever, around mid-year, I started to get impatient with the whole manual setup\nand stopped logging my data. So, unfortunately, I don't have any way to analyze\nall these patterns now. I am totally disappointed with the lack of any standard\ntool that can collect at least mobile usage data while also ensuring privacy.\nRescue time is something I have thought about, but I cannot convince myself to\nuse that app due to privacy issues.\n\nBelow are my media consumption habits from 2021 -\n\n![Media consumption in 2021](/images/posts/2021_media_consumption.png \"Media consumption in 2021\")\n\nFor some reason, I watched a lot of content in the last two months of 2021.\nPossible reasons may be my acceptance of the new job offer or my truce with the\nweather. For whatever reason, I consider this year a controlled one in the\nbinge-watching department.\n\n## What in 2022?\n\n- Build muscles - Now that my weight is at an appropriate level, it is time for\n  me to build some muscles.\n- Read 24 books - I plan to read 24 books this year. I am yet to decide if I\n  want to focus on a particular subject or diversify my reading.\n- Phone usage - Planning to keep it under 3 hours. However, I need to figure out\n  how to export this data out of my phone.\n\nAs you might have noticed, most of my failures in 2021 have something to do with\nmy habit of doing things perfectly. While it is good to perform any task as\ncleanly as possible, it sometimes becomes a big hurdle in starting up. In 2022,\nI hope to keep this tendency at bay as much as possible.\n",

      "content_html": "\nI turned 25 in the week gone by. I have been on the earth for a quarter of a\ncentury now, and the feelings are mixed. I love to write about myself, even at\nthe risk of overexposing myself to the general world. This helps me in\nremembering my younger self. That, I think, is the best yardstick to judge\nmyself against. Unfortunately, while I should write positive things, the tone of\nmost of my personal experience articles tends to be negative. It is instinctive\nand something that I have not learned to control just yet. Nevertheless, I will\nconsider myself successful when I look back at my life, and the memories make me\nsmile. Some of my previous posts do make me smile.\n\nThe last one month or so has been tough on me. Suddenly, all my plans started to\ncollapse, I started feeling depressed, and the feeling of being an imposter hit\nme hard once again. All this coincided with the second wave of COVID-19 in\nIndia, and it is easy for me to blame COVID. But there are certainly other\nreasons that have been building up for the last few years. The eruption of these\naccumulated worries from time to time drains me down. This has been the essence\nof my life for the previous few years since I started having an idea of\nself-ownership.\n\n### Borrowing from future and past\n\nI see many of my friends and colleagues opting for higher studies abroad or in\ntop institutes of India. While I also had such plans in the past, circumstances\nforced me to kneel down. I had hoped that I have adjusted to this reality. But a\nconstant wave of social media posts from friends and people leaving the\nworkplace has negatively affected my subconscious mind. Given that I decided\nwith maturity and complete understanding of the situation, I don’t know who or\nwhat to blame for my current mental state. I guess I just need to give it some\ntime, and it will subside on its own.\n\nI often tend to compare myself against others and feel low seeing people doing\nbetter than me. It is definitely not jealousy, but being competitive has so\nintrinsically become part of me that I can’t help. Somewhere deep down, I also\nknow that this comparison is futile. Different people can have different life\nsituations, and life is not the same for any two persons. A better option for me\nis to compare against my younger self and see how much I have changed. That\nshould be easy to do, given my habit of writing my experiences frequently. I\ndon't know what is holding me back.\n\nWhen I look back at my childhood, I see a weak, frail boy bullied by good and\nbad alike. Unfortunately, I never mustered the courage to fight them back. The\nbullying and my subsequent retreat into a cocoon have had a lasting impact on my\nlife. I am still trying to reverse it. On the other hand, I still think that I\nam a born introvert. My life experiences might undoubtedly have given my\npersonality its current shape, but it didn't all start with a blank slate.\n\n### The struggles of the present\n\nOne thing I am very proud of myself is that I never lost my curiosity. I am\nstill inquisitive. I love to learn anything and everything that I can put my\nhands on (perhaps except artistic stuff). But what kills my enthusiasm is the\nfact that I don’t utilize my learnings in any way. I tend to live my life in the\nsame way I have been living it till now. There is no adventure whatsoever in my\nlife, as I see it. It is as if whatever new I learn doesn’t make any impact on\nmy day-to-day life. When I think about it deeply, it appears to be a very\nunfortunate aspect of my quest for knowledge.\n\nFor instance, let us talk about reading. I agree that we should not read to\nremember, and that way, definitely reading has given me some new perspectives. I\nhave read anywhere between 90-100 good quality books in the last one and half\nyears. During a typical day, I get many insights related to whatever I have\nread. But when I sit down to articulate them in the form of a blog post or a\npersonal note, I go blank. According to my introspection, it seems that most of\nmy learnings are just superficial and I suffer from so-called illusion of\nknowledge. This reminds me of a quote by Daniel J. Boorstin -\n\nAnother thing is my short attention span. I can’t focus on one thing for more\nthan a couple of minutes now. This is one thing that has deteriorated over the\nyears as I become more and more connected. I know that meditation will\ndefinitely help me with this issue. Still, I can’t find the motivation to keep\nmeditating continuously. I can start meditating any day. I can continue it for\nsome days by using my willpower, but this is not sustainable. With a limited\nstock of willpower, I am bound to fail unless I make meditation a habit. I have\nalmost cut myself from social media, instant messaging apps, and all other forms\nof communication to focus on the important stuff in my free time. Still, somehow\nmy attention betrays me every single time.\n\nFor a couple of years now, I have been blaming my undecidedness to write\nregularly on so-called “writer's block.” This is a complete sham. It has just\nserved as a cover for my laziness and unwillingness. I often convince myself\nsaying that I should first acquire knowledge. Then, one fine morning, I will\nwake up and write world-shaking articles. Of course, this is never going to\nhappen, but why not, it is a good excuse to keep me happy with my comfort zone.\n\n### Conundrums of asking for help\n\nThere have been many people in my life who have offered to guide me and help me\nrealize my goals. However, my reserved nature and the feeling of being an\nimposter have stopped me from opening up to anyone. I have been struggling with\nimposter syndrome for the last 3-4 years. I am not sure about the reasons yet.\nStill, I think my hesitation in requesting a “familiar” person for mentorship\narises from the feeling that I might not perform as they would expect me to do.\nThat would shatter my image in front of them. Therefore, my subconscious mind\nhas decided that it is more optimal to keep the (false?) impression intact\ninstead of getting the required help. That might also answer why I never share\nmy articles with anyone. It is a fact that I don’t feel very confident about\nmyself and my work. It has affected me at the workplace, and perhaps it will\ncontinue affecting me in the coming years. The only way I can think of to get\nrid of this problem is to face it.\n\nI have also often struggled to take criticism constructively. Somehow my\negoistic nature and perfectionistic tendencies mixed with imposter syndrome make\nit challenging to learn from criticism. Just to clarify, I don’t mean that I\nharbor any ill thoughts for the criticizer. It is something personal, and I\ndon’t have any words to describe it right now.\n\n### The illusion of competence\n\nWhile reading has given me new and unique perspectives to think about the world,\nit has also given me an illusion of competence. I feel like I know a lot, but\nwhen it comes to utilizing the “earned” knowledge, I cannot interconnect my\nthoughts. I have seemingly different areas of interest, and that is reflected in\nmy reading habits. My expectation is that diverse reading habits will result in\na future me who will gather ideas from multiple fields and interconnect them to\nbuild a novel abstraction. I am not sure if this is a far-fetched desire and\neven possible for an average human. But I can’t push myself away from this\nthought. Over the years, this has become one of many ambitions to get to that\nstate. I don’t know if I will ever reach that point, but I don’t see any harm in\nkeep trying. My only worry is how to stay away from the illusion of expert-level\ncompetence in a field, while I don’t know actually have any expertise.\n\n### The political me\n\nThose who know me in my personal life will attest that I am not able to stay\nloyal to any one side of the political spectrum. I have always see-sawed between\nleft and right. Of course, this see-sawing has subjected me to \"gentle\" bashing\nfrom my friends adhering to either ideology. Famous Hindi poet Ramdhari Singh\nDinakar very accurately points out the situation -\n\nNow, this is one of the paradoxes that troubles me quite frequently. While\ntaking sides mean losing some of your individuality, not taking sides is also\nequivalent to not having a clear goal in mind, in a way.\n\nSince when I started reading profusely, I have tried to keep this balance\nintact. I have made conscious efforts not to form _strong_ opinions and not\nadhere to one particular ideology without looking at facts and data. The\nengineer's mind weighs everything in terms of data and facts and filters out\npersonal opinions.\n\nI read a lot about foreign policy, society, culture, caste, religion, economy,\nhistory, and the constantly evolving political structure of India and the World.\nBut, unfortunately, most of the quality media is dominated by the left. I don't\nwant to engage with keyboard-warriors on Twitter, WhatsApp, and elsewhere, so\nthat leaves me with significantly less material to know the genuine viewpoint of\nthe other side.\n\nOver the years, I have realized that socially I tend to be on the center-left\nand economically, on center-right. But sharing political views in the public\ndomain without proper research is not ideal. I want to consolidate my learnings\nand form well-informed and well-analyzed opinions on happenings in the world in\ngeneral and India in particular before I participate in political discourse. It\ndoes not mean that I don't have any political opinions. Most events cannot be\ncategorized as good or bad; it is just how one wants to perceive the world.\nTherefore, I constantly try to avoid getting influenced by what a random\njournalist with certain motives, sitting in a high-rise AC office, might want me\nto believe.\n\n### The CS guy!\n\nThough I hated Computer Science a couple of years back, I have worked on my\nfears. Now, at least I don’t have any understanding issues with the core CS\nsubjects (except DBMS, perhaps. I don’t like it; at all!) I didn’t focus on\nunderstanding whatever CS theory was taught during my undergraduate (again, a\nlack of proper mentorship.) Although this doesn’t harm me in my professional\nlife, I want to get some kind of research experience at some point in my life.\nUnfortunately, it seems unlikely for me to enroll in a full-time graduate\nprogram in the foreseeable future. So, I am weighing my options to go for a\nSystems course via online studies. Assuming I get admission, one option is a\nsponsored graduate program (such as this\n[one](https://iken.iisc.ac.in/mtech-online/) offered by IISc.) Another option is\nto go for an online [MS degree](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) provided by some US\nuniversities. I will surely miss the unique campus experience, but I hope it\nwill still quench my intellectual thirst. I currently have some other stuff on\nmy plate. I will try to finish them before deciding if and when I should opt for\nthese options. I hope to make a call in the next two years in the worst-case\nscenario.\n\n### Originality\n\nBy originality, I mean a way to build upon something existing — some kind of\nimprovement upon an already existing thing, idea, or abstraction. Almost\neverything humans have created has been an improvement over something preceding\nit, either man-made or natural. In my opinion, originality is a creative process\nto generate novel ideas improving upon existing processes, things, tools, and\nknowledge systems to make them more desirable, optimized, user-friendly, and\ninsightful. Original need not be \"original\" in its literal sense.\n\nWhile I have been working on my CS skills, it is not the field where I get my\nmost original thoughts and ideas, despite being the subject where I spent 4\nyears of my life. I have met many amazing people in Cisco over the last 3 years.\nI am often awestruck by their ability and passion for continuously generating\nnew ideas. Whether it is a Hackathon or a Patentothon, I have been fortunate to\nteam up with people who can generate exciting ideas with surprising depth.\nHowever, I have thought about it and realized that I am not yet at that level\nwhere I can generate original ideas worthy of patenting or publication. Some\npeople are just born with that kind of talent, and some acquire skills superior\nto any talent. With growing experience, I might get to that level someday, but\ncurrently, I am yet another average Indian software engineer. Read the last\nsection of this article to know why I am content with this situation for now.\n\nOn the other hand, the fields where I tend to get many ideas nowadays are\nreligion, politics, and history. One possible reason behind this might be that\nthese subjects are my area of interest nowadays, and I read related books during\nmy non-work day. So my mind gets a lot of time to consolidate this stuff.\n\nIt is such a contentious issue for me that I feel embarrassed talking about it.\nIn fact, this is the first time I have actually given any thoughts on this\ntopic. And I am glad that I did it. I wrote above my initial impressions about\nan issue I was unaware of until a few moments ago. I hope to get more clarity\nand insights into the real reasons behind my lack of enthusiasm to produce new\nideas in the coming time.\n\n---\n\nEven if not entirely by choice, I am trying to embrace the slow-growth mindset,\ntaking short-term hits for long-term gains. I hope this gamble will pay off, as\nI think it will be the right approach. Long-term gains far outweigh short-term\nbenefits when it is a matter of whole life.\n\nWhile I keep whining about my future and past and try to piece together my\npresent, this quote sums up the way forward succinctly —\n",

      "content_html": "\n![The Family Man 2](/images/posts/the-family-man-2-cover.jpg \"The Family Man 2\")\n\nI binge-watched the second season of The Family Man (TFM) 2 last night. I was\neagerly waiting for this season of TFM for a long time, especially after the\nhighly gripping season 1. And I am not disappointed. While I watch digital\ncontent very selectively (young-adult fantasy depicting a dark and mid-age\nEurope and Russia and spy-genre Indian shows for occasional patriotic doses),\nvery few shows have such excellent cinematography. It is the plot of TFM2 that\nmade me ask some questions myself. While I don’t have clear answers to them yet,\nI thought I will just list them down, along with some of my raw thoughts.\n\nThe plot is about the resistance of Eelam Tamils of Sri Lanka against the Sri\nLankan government. The topic is riddled with complex matters of morality,\nhumanity, human rights, ethnicity, language, majority-minority conflicts, and\nthe right to self-governance. Sri Lankan conflict is familiar to most Indians\nbecause of India’s involvement in the struggle in the early 1980s and 90s and\nthe subsequent assassination of Rajiv Gandhi during an election campaign in\nChennai. Many such issues are spread throughout the world — e.g.,\nIsrael-Palestine conflict, Rohingya issue in Myanmar, Nagaland in India.\nSpecific questions that perplex me about these conflicts are -\n\n1. Why do people fight for their ethnicity? How difficult is it to live\n   alongside other people under a defined constitution prepared with a mutual\n   agreement?\n2. Why are modern nation-states reluctant to give autonomy or independence to\n   such groups just to avoid bloodshed?\n3. What are the causes of the origins of such conflicts?\n4. Are there any examples where the final settlement was acceptable to both\n   sides, and nobody left the table feeling betrayed?\n\nI look for academic (Sociology, Anthropology, and Political Science, to be\nprecise) answers to these questions. I understand that ground realities are\noften very different than what we learn from news media and books. Humans tend\nto have a natural connection to their perceived kinsmen. Why do you think nature\nhas decided to keep a human baby dependent on her parents for almost 1/4th of\nher average lifetime? The bond we generate with our society, tribe, kin, and\nfamily stays with us forever, and we strive to keep them safe and secure at any\ncost.\n\nI will give a controversial example - the Indian freedom struggle is a revered\nmovement for most Indians, including myself. Still, for the then British rulers,\nit was a rebellion that had to be suppressed at any cost to save their empire.\nWe despise the atrocities performed by the British on Indian people. How is that\ndifferent from the horrors seen in the conflicts of the modern world (not just\nthe people in power, rebels everywhere have also committed unspeakable\natrocities). As I understand it, it is not a binary problem; there is no black\nand white in this. There are shades of grey and what amount of black you see\ndepends on a lot of factors. Just be aware of the fact that the more powerful\nside need not be the necessary evil. Resolving any conflict requires some\ncompromises from both sides. Until both sides are leaving the table feeling that\nthey won, no negotiation will be successful. Remember -\n",

      "content_html": "\nWhile I thought of writing this review on 31st December, I couldn't overcome my\nlaziness. It has been a persistent problem with me in 2020, which I haven't been\nable to fix as of now. On average, the year 2020 was a good year for me. It\nwasn't equally forgiving to me on every issue of my life, but it was most\nundoubtedly lenient on the issues I consider most important at this phase of my\nlife. As for most people, it was a year of self-retrospection for me as well. I\nidentified some new goals in my life, forgot some others, compromised with some\nfailures, and learned the value of loved ones.\n\nLike previous years, I have identified some critical areas of my life, where I\nam putting more focus year after year. It is easier to focus on one topic at a\ntime. I have decided to omit some parts of my life from this write-up because I\nam not yet ready to reveal them to a specific set of people (although very few\npeople read this blog now, thanks to my irregularity, I prefer to stay\nrisk-averse).\n\n## Health\n\n2020 belonged to the pandemic. So it is most prudent to start with the topic of\nhealth. For the last some years, I have been struggling with a lot of\nhealth-related issues. Although this year was a much better one for my body and\nmind, I am still petrified of my health issues. It seems that I am a\nworry-magnet, and the worry of catching coronavirus was the biggest of them all\nthis year. I spent almost 3-4 months in this worry. It took some toll on my\nhealth, but in the end, I was able to come out of it, thanks to family.\n\nI should give part of the blame to my laziness. I had stopped all my learning\nactivities in the mid-to-late year (perhaps I was exhausted). And that gave way\nto evil thoughts in my mind. As they say, \"An idle mind is the devil's\nworkshop!\". Thankfully I got hold of the situation while it was still\nmanageable.\n\n![Sleeping in 2020](/images/posts/2020_sleep_hours.jpg \"How much I slept in 2020?\")\n\nThis graph shows how my sleeping times changed throughout the year. I lost track\nin the third quarter of the year. Anyway, in December, I seem to have come back\nto the correct path.\n\nThis chart doesn't convey certain things very clearly. First, it shows the\naverage amount of time I slept in a particular month. However, that time\nincludes the afternoon nap also. And in the mid-year months, where you see 9+\nhours of sleep, it means that I was sleeping quite a lot in the afternoon and\nless at night. In the last three months of the year, I have been trying to\nregulate my sleep timings at night, and I am quite satisfied with my progress. I\nhave observed over the years with my sleep experiments that whenever I start\nsleeping less at night, I tend to exhaust myself in the next couple of months.\nThis theory got validated this year when I exhausted myself from June onwards,\nand my health issues reappeared after sleeping significantly less in April and\nMay (night sleep).\n\nI _actually_ did some exercise this year. I bought a gym subscription this year,\nbut unfortunately, that became my worst financial decision in the last several\nyears because I left Bengaluru before the government imposed the lockdowns.\nHowever, I did some light exercise at home. That didn't do wonders, but at least\nI was able to keep my BMI constant throughout the year. Even after eating\ndelicacies prepared by Mom all year!!! :heart_eyes: Hopefully, I will be able to\nstart running in 2021, even if only on weekends.\n\nIn November, I suffered from severe back pain. After getting an ergonomic chair,\nthings seem to be in control. But that incident reminded me of the importance of\nexercise. I will try to include some simple back exercises in 2021.\n\n## Family\n\nThe year 2020 was quite an unusual year on this front. Since I started at NITC\nin July 2014, I have been away from my family for most years. But thanks to\nlockdown, I got to spend time with my family this year. I had anticipated\nlockdowns in India quite early, so I left Bengaluru in March just before the\ngovernment imposed lockdowns in a \"shock and awe\" manner. So I reached home on\ntime, and that was the best decision I have taken this year. If not for my\nfamily, I don't think I would have been able to handle pandemic-induced health\nissues.\n\nI have been away from my brother for almost seven years now. More importantly,\nthese seven years were the life-defining years for both of us. It turns out that\nhe and I think very differently. I guess that our thinking results from the\ndifferent environments where we spent our early adulthood. It was initially very\ntough to agree on something, but we slowly learned to agree to disagree. Staying\naway from family has made me more careful and risk-averse in some sense. I tend\nto (over) analyze everything, and that causes delays in decision making. On the\nother hand, he is quite free-minded and rebellious. How different we both have\nturned out to be!!!\n\nI don't mind this variety, though.\n\n## Reading\n\nI had set a target to read 20 books this year. In the end, I managed to read a\nlot more than 20. Mid-year, Around July/August, I started losing track of the\nbooks I was reading. As I mentioned in my last year's review, I was getting\ndisillusioned with Goodreads for some time. This year I tried to use it, but\nultimately I didn't log the majority of my reading anywhere. I don't know if\nthis is a good thing to do. I will try to keep it this way for some more time\nand then analyze the data-collection pros and cons.\n\nI have identified some issues with my reading pattern. I tend to read the books\npassively. That makes it quite challenging to retain knowledge for the long\nterm. On top of that, I don't make notes as well. So, I cannot even revise the\ncontent quickly without going through the whole book again, which is\ncounter-productive. It is a childhood habit, and I assume it will be tough to\nbreak this habit. However, whenever possible, I now actively remind myself to\nquestion the book and not take everything written in the book for granted. It\nwill take some time (perhaps years), but I am confident about changing this\ntendency.\n\nI read a variety of books this year. Most of these books were related to\nhumanities subjects like political science, history, etc. I got interested in\ntech quite late in my life. Before that, humanities was my favorite pastime.\nOnce I entered the tech field, I somehow couldn't continue this. But this year,\nI found myself distancing from technical topics somewhere around June. There is\na reason behind that disinterest that I would like to keep private for now. At\nthe same time, I struggled with my health issues, so I decided to start with\nhumanities again. Looking back at that decision, I feel it was a superb choice.\nI have learned so much about India, its history, and the present. Somehow, I was\nable to ask questions about why a particular thing was done the way it was done.\nI was never able to think like that while reading a technical book. Does that\nmake my knowledge about tech hollow? I don't know yet. But I will be actively\nlooking for an answer in the coming times.\n\nOne subject, where I expected to glide through was Economics. I\n[mentioned](/blog/2018-year-in-review/#reading) in my 2018 review that I find\nEconomics interesting and want to learn more about it. I couldn't do that in\n2019, but this year I decided to pursue that goal. So I started with the most\nfundamental books - NCERT class 12th Microeconomics and Macroeconomics. The\nresult is that I have lost my interest in learning economics now (hopefully\ntemporarily). Either the books are written horribly, or I didn't put enough\neffort. It took me ages to complete these two books, and still, I don't\nunderstand a lot of the concepts. I think it was the wrong strategy to start\nwith these books. I should have watched video lectures by some University\nprofessors. Perhaps I will do that this year, whenever I get time from my other\ngoals.\n\nAnother subject, which caught my interest was Anthropology. I had\n[read](https://highlights.yashagarwal.in/posts/2019-02-16-sapiens/) the\nexcellent \"Sapiens\" book by Yuval Noah Harari a couple of years back, and that\nwas a thought-provoking read for me. So I decided to read further on the topic\nto answer some of the questions that I had about human society and why certain\ncultural elements got evolved in the way they are at present. It is quite an\ninteresting subject, specifically social and cultural anthropology.\n\nBelow are some of the superficial statistics about the books that I read this\nyear -\n\n|              | Year Goal | Achieved |\n| ------------ | --------- | -------- |\n| Read/to-read | 20        | 69       |\n| Numpages     | 7000      | 16279    |\n| pages/day    | 19.13     | 44.48    |\n| days/book    | 18.30     | 5.30     |\n| book/month   | 1.67      | 5.75     |\n\nOnce again, these numbers are not accurate indicators of the quality of reading.\nNot all of the books were worth reading. I consider around 25 of these books as\na waste of my time. Some books were as small as 100 pages, while some were so\ngood that I wanted more even after reading 800+ pages.\n\nNow, the question is how many of these books benefited me. I plan to reread some\nof these books and prepare some notes after/along with the second reading. I\nhave tried writing on paper, but my perfectionistic tendencies stop me from\n\"spoiling\" the paper. So I will make the notes on Onenote this time and write\nthem down on paper later. Rewriting on paper is a compulsion because my mind\nseems to be having issues recalling digitally-read content. It is one reason why\nmy Kindle is inside my drawer for a very long time.\n\nOne of my wishes for 2021 is to read\n[The Story of Civilization](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78159.The_Story_of_Civilization).\n\n## Blogging and Writing\n\nIt is quite evident from this blog's activity in 2020 that I didn't write very\nactively. I am going through a challenging phase (imposter syndrome?) in my tech\njourney that is difficult to describe. I started this blog when I was actively\nlearning new things in tech. But now, I have almost hit a plateau. If I phrase\nit in another way, I am not learning enough technical content now. I don't think\nit is related to my work, but somehow, my attention has been on other things\nlately.\n\nI have not been able to write anything on paper as well. I did some analysis on\nthis issue, and it turns out that I have perfectionist tendencies, as I\nmentioned in the last section. I try to do everything with perfection, and that\ndoesn't work most of the time. You can't always have everything perfect in real\nlife, although aiming for perfectionism is not a bad thing. But when this goal\nbecomes the process, it starts creating problems. And I am facing the same\nissue. Now, whenever I sit to write anything, I remind myself at regular\nintervals that I don't have to be perfect all the time. It seems to work till\nnow.\n\nAnyway, in 2021, I will write a lot on paper and perhaps on this blog. I am\nstill contemplating if I should write long-form essays on some contemporary\nissues on this blog. Maybe I will create a new WordPress blog for that kind of\nstuff and keep this blog for my technical content and everyday life-related\nposts.\n\nI figured out one more issue with my thought process. Given a topic, if you ask\nme to write a summary of it, I wouldn't be able to articulate my thoughts.\nSomething that Richard Feynman was very good at. In other words, I struggle in\nexplaining my knowledge to others. I guess this means that I don't understand\nthe topic well enough to write anything about it. It might also mean that I have\nsome issues in thinking clearly. I hope, with practice, more active reading, and\nregular writing practice, I will win over this issue.\n\n## Work\n\nIt isn't easy to summarise my work experience. It's my third year at Cisco now.\nThe team in which I was working for the last two years got dissolved. However,\nhigher management was quite helpful in transitioning to a new team working on\nSnort development. So, I will be getting a much-needed product development\nexperience now. Till now, all is good; however, product development is slightly\nweird. I need to give it more time before drawing any conclusions. Since I have\njoined the new team, I feel that my day-to-day learning has suffered during work\nhours. I hope it is a temporary phenomenon and I would be able to overcome it\nsoon.\n\nThe COVID outbreak has spoiled some of my plans, and I am unsure if my familial\ncircumstances would allow me to opt for those plans in the near future. I\nreoriented my goals to adjust to the changing conditions. But whatever happens,\nI will try to utilize the available resources to the maximum extent possible.\nHopefully, everything will settle in the right place soon.\n\n## Media Consumption\n\nI seem to have been able to conquer the addiction to social media. I had been\ntrying to do this for 3-4 years, and this year, I feel that I was in control for\nmost of the time. Whenever I lost myself in Twitter/Quora/Reddit, I found it\neasy to cut-off myself from these websites without any withdrawal symptoms,\nwhich is a very pleasing experience.\n\nFacebook deserves a special mention here. I have been entirely out of touch with\nFacebook for the last couple of years, partly due to self-control and partly due\nto the bad press Facebook has recently gotten. One thing that has helped me is\nthat I don't have any content on my newsfeed because I took some time to\nunfollow everyone. As there is no content to scroll, I don't feel the urge to\nstay longer on the website. I log in occasionally to the website just for\nchecking the notification and friend requests.\n\nComing to the media content consumed by me, these are the movies that I watched\nthis year. I did a lousy job logging this stuff, so this data is not\ncomprehensive. Of course, I watched a lot more movies than this.\n\n![Movies in 2020](/images/posts/2020_movies_watched.jpg \"Movies in 2020\")\n\nI watched many web series during the July-October period. I can recall a few\nright now - Sacred Games 1 and 2, She, Flesh, Bard of Blood, Mirzapur 1 and 2,\nThe Witcher, Sex Education, and Paatal Lok. In short, I wasted a lot of time\nwatching useless content. Sensory satisfaction, peer pressure, and the urge to\nrun away from my boredom are to blame for this binge-watching time.\n\nI am using [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/yagr/) to log the movies, but\nthere does not seem to be a _free_ service that offers both movies and web\nseries logging. I wish somebody will make one in 2021.\n\nI use an Android phone and use Digital Wellbeing to monitor my phone usage.\nUnfortunately, I can't export my usage data from the Digital Wellbeing app. This\ndata gets lost because I switch ROMs frequently. However, according to my\nliberal estimate, I was able to keep my per day phone usage under 4 hours on\nmost of the days. There were some outliers, but mostly, my phone addiction was\nrelatively under control. However, I would have liked to keep it around 3 hours\nper day.\n\n## What in 2021?\n\nThis section is a new addition to this year's review. I usually don't set\nexplicit targets and certainly don't share them in public. So this is something\ndifferent. I am sharing my goals here. I will take this as a benchmark when I\nsit to write my year review for 2021. I am hoping for at least a 60% success\nrate.\n\n- **Publish six long-form essays** - The plan is to learn the skill of\n  articulating thoughts. I don't have any particular topic in mind. Perhaps a\n  mix of History, Political Science and Tech. It can be in the form of essays or\n  an explanatory post, or anything else. Ideally, every two months.\n- **Read five fiction books** - To learn how other people write fantasy. I hope\n  to be able to read it for learning, not just for fun. You can follow my\n  progress [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63354397-yash).\n- **Sleep at proper times** - Now that majority of my work meetings are expected\n  to get scheduled during IST, I will try to sleep by 10 PM and sleep for at\n  least 8 hours every day. I am aiming for an 80% success rate in this aspect.\n- **Phone Usage** - Keep it under 3.5 hours per day (Aiming for 80% success)\n- **Write a Journal** - I have tried it earlier also but failed. This year, I\n  will try to document only important events in my life. At least once a month\n  should be good enough. The more the merrier!\n- **Regular exercise** - I need to reduce my BMI to 22 from 23.3. That requires\n  me to shed at least 4 kgs of weight.\n  - Weekend running (Aiming to do it on 50/104 weekends, accounting for winters)\n  - Mild 15-minute exercises at home two days a week (Aiming for 80% success)\n  - Meditation on the two days of the week (Aiming for 90% success)\n- ██████ (redacted) - I want to achieve this one badly.\n\n**Note**: A number of these goals depend on how many more months I get to spend\nat home, after June.\n\n---\n\n2020 was quite a year. I hope humanity has learned its lessons. While\nindustrialization and globalization have brought us a couple of hours away from\neach other, it has become equally easy for pathogens and germs to travel and\nreach farther ends of the world. I like to equate this situation to the\ndisease-carrying Europeans who went to the Americas in the 17th century. Nations\ncould practice some carefulness and proactivity in dealing with such problems.\nIt is not the last pandemic to ravage the world, for sure.\n\n_I expect to achieve some of my goals in 2021, but I won't deny a potential role\nof luck or chance (whatever you like to call it). Hopefully, the gods of chance\nwill be on my side._\n",

      "content_html": "\nI completed two years at Cisco in August recently. I think it is a good time to\njot down my learnings and experiences from the past two years. It was my first\ncorporate job; however, I did not land up in a typical software development job.\nHence, my experiences are quite different and unique in a sense.\n\nI joined Cisco in 2018. As it usually happens with university recruits, I was\nalso randomly assigned to a team in the Office of CTO in Security Business Group\n(SBG) in Cisco. I got assigned to a non-product team that worked in a\nsemi-research environment to develop PoCs demonstrating the integration of\nfuture-looking technologies with the existing Cisco portfolio. The nature of\nthis work gave me some exciting skills and exposure to latest trends in\nindustry, but it came with its own set of disadvantages. I will discuss some of\nthem at the end of this article.\n\n## Take Ownership of your work\n\nEvery member worked on a reasonably independent project in my team, directly\nsupervised by a Principal Engineer or a Technical Lead. Most of my superiors\n(including my manager) were located in the USA, so there were many early-night\nmeetings involved. This also meant that nobody watched (micromanaged 🙊) me, and\nI was given quite a bit of autonomy. I really appreciate this aspect.\n\nI learned how to come out of a problem when there is nobody to help or guide\nyou. Of course, I asked for help whenever needed; the freedom I enjoyed at work\nwas unparalleled.\n\nDuring two years, there were many occasions when some of my design and\ndevelopment choices were questioned. I successfully defended some of them and\nhad to change the others. In the process, I learned the caveats in my\nunderstanding and the importance of others' perspectives while solving difficult\nproblems.\n\n## Developers should have experience with operations\n\nAs I mentioned above, most of my projects were individual projects. Naturally,\nthe responsibility of setting up and maintenance of the build-environment also\nfell on my shoulders. My experience with Linux system administration from\ncollege time came to my rescue here. In the process, I learned how invaluable\nthe skills of DevOps can be for a developer.\n\nThere is a lot that I don't know yet, but my basics have grown strong enough to\ngrasp any new technology in a reasonable amount of time over the past two years.\n\n## Communications\n\nI have never been a good speaker, and talking to strangers has been one of my\nweakest skills. After joining Cisco, this aspect of my personality has changed\nconsiderably. Attending regular meetings and speaking about my ideas and work\ngave me confidence. There are still some caveats with my public speaking skills.\nI hope that I would be able to overcome these challenges with more experience.\n\n## Innovation\n\nThe industry provides you access to the best minds in your field. You get to\nmeet wise people working and using their knowledge and expertise to generate\nideas that can change the world (or at least the industry). It motivates you to\ncompete with them. Although I have been unable to generate any patentable idea\nin the past two years, I have been invited to participate in the discussions,\nwhich led to patent applications. My biggest takeaway from these discussions was\nthat breadth is more useful than depth when it comes to idea generation. Knowing\nvarious fields and connecting two seemingly different domains is a skill whose\nimportance cannot be overemphasized.\n\nAnother thing I learned is that aiming for perfection doesn't help anyone. To\nkeep waiting for that best idea to pop up in your mind is illusionary and will\nnever happen. I have been a victim of this tendency to perfectionism the whole\nof my life. For the past couple of months, I have been actively trying to avoid\nthis habit. My inconsistency in regularly writing on this blog can also be\nattributed to my search for the _ideal_ blog post.\n\nIn my opinion, quantity is better than quality. The same is true with the\ngeneration of ideas. If you keep waiting that you will get the ultimate idea one\nday, believe me, it will never happen.\n\n## Take a step back & rethink\n\nIt happened quite a few times that I started looking for a solution to a problem\nin one direction. After spending a considerable amount of time, I figured out\nthat the direction was wrong or worse, my understanding of the problem was\nwrong. In such situations, it is better to backtrack and think again. It also\nhelps to ask someone for help. Sometimes, others can give you a different\nperspective that you might not be able to see.\n\n## Don't hesitate to brag about yourself\n\nWhen I joined Cisco, my colleagues suggested me to set up 1-1 with my manager to\nstay in touch with him and showcase my work. I hesitated. I thought that what is\nthe point of talking about my work when it is visible to everybody through\nweekly meetings. Now I understand, it is such a crucial step which shouldn't be\nignored at all. Keep a [brag](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) document and\nuse it to keep records of your work, achievements, and accomplishments. I never\nneeded it till now, but I plan to use it in the future.\n\n---\n\nComing to downsides, I have only one qualm. As I mentioned above, my team was\nnot a product team. So I missed out on some of the necessary product development\nexperience. I believe that having some experience developing and shipping\nproduction-ready code is an absolute requirement to move towards my career\ngoals. Thankfully, I have switched my team now, and now I will be working on a\nfull-fledged security offering of Cisco.\n\n---\n\nSo, these are some of my insights from the past two years at Cisco. I want to\nshare a lot of other thoughts, but their time hasn't come yet. I will definitely\nshare more of these as I spend more time in the industry and tech.\n",

      "content_html": "\nCassandra is a distributed storage system that can spread over thousands of\nnodes and store terabytes of structured data. Cassandra was developed at\nFacebook to solve performance issues during searches in Facebook Inbox.\nCassandra can provide a highly available service without a single point of\nfailure.\n\nCassandra borrows some of its architecture choices from Google's\n[BigTable](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf)\nand Amazon's\n[Dynamo](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf).\nIn some ways, Cassandra resembles the traditional databases, yet it does not\nsupport the relational data model completely.\n\n## Data Model\n\nCassandra uses a tabular data structure like relational databases. A table in\nCassandra is a distributed multi-dimensional map indexed by a key. Every row\noperation is atomic per replica, no matter how many columns are being read or\nwritten into. Cassandra groups columns into sets called column family. A column\nfamily is of two types - Simple and Super (column family within column family).\nCassandra can sort columns using name or time. Time-based sorting is useful when\nused in a setting like Inbox searches where most recent messages should be\ndisplayed first.\n\nCassandra provides following methods -\n\n1. $insert(table, key, rowMutation)$\n2. $get(table, key, tableName)$\n3. $delete(table, key, tableName)$\n\n## Architecture\n\nA data storage system should satisfy some requirements - data persistence,\nscalability, membership, failure detection and handling, data partitioning,\nrequest routing, among others. Cassandra uses a variety of techniques to solve\nthese issues.\n\n### Routing\n\nAny node can attend an incoming read/write request with a key. Each node in the\nCassandra cluster knows about other nodes. The serving node uses this\ninformation and the request's key to determine the route of the request to the\nappropriate node.\n\nIn the case of write requests, the system routes the request to all replicas and\nwaits for a quorum of replicas to acknowledge the completion of the writes.\n\nFor reads, the system either routes the requests to the nearest replica with\nrequired data or forwards the request to all the replicas and waits for a quorum\nof responses before replying. Which method, the system utilizes, depends on the\nconsistency requirements of the client.\n\n### Partitioning\n\nCassandra uses\n[consistent hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing) with an\norder-preserving hash. The consistent hash function is used to hash the data key\nto generate identifiers. The output range of the hash function is treated as a\nring (the largest hash value generated wraps around the smallest hash value).\nEach node is assigned a random hash, which becomes its position on the ring.\nEach node is responsible for the region in the ring between it and its\npredecessor node.\n\nFor each data item with a key, its hash is generated using the key. The ring is\ntraversed clockwise, and the first node with the position hash value greater\nthan the item's hash value is assigned to the data item. This node is deemed the\ncoordinator of the key.\n\nHowever, consistent hashing can result in an imbalance in the load distribution\nand non-uniformity of data distribution. Cassandra solves these issues by\nperiodically analyzing the load information in the ring and repositioning the\nlightly loaded nodes on the ring to alleviate high load nodes.\n\n### Replication\n\nEach data item is replicated at $N$ nodes in the ring. As mentioned above, each\ndata item's key is assigned to a coordinator node, which is responsible for the\nreplication of data items falling within its range (the region between it and\nits predecessor node). For fault tolerance, in addition to locally storing keys,\nthe coordinator node replicates these keys at the $(N-1)$ replicas on the ring.\nReplication policies such as Rack aware, Rack unaware, Datacenter aware are used\nfor this purpose.\n\n### Leader Election\n\nCassandra uses Zookeeper for leader election and fault tolerance. Whenever a new\nnode joins the cluster, it contacts the leader who tells them what ranges the\nnode is responsible for. The metadata about ranges of a node is cached locally\nas well as on the Zookeeper instance.\n\n### Membership\n\nCassandra uses Scuttlebutt - an anti-entropy Gossip based protocol to\ndisseminate the membership information inside the ring. Whenever a new node\njoins the system, it calculates a token for itself. This token is gossiped\naround the cluster. That's how each node in the system knows about the\nmembership and positions of other nodes in the system.\n\n### Failure Detection\n\nFailure detection is a mechanism by which a node can locally determine if any\nother node in the system is up or down. Cassandra uses a modified version of\n$\\phi$-Accrual Failure Detector. The basic idea is that the failure detection\nmodule emits the suspicion level of a node instead of a binary up/down status.\nThis suspicion level is $\\phi$. The idea is to represent $\\phi$ on a dynamically\nadjustable scale, which reflects network and load conditions at the monitored\nnodes.\n\nEvery node in the system maintains a sliding window of inter-arrival times of\ngossip messages from other nodes in the cluster. The distribution of these\ninter-arrival times is determined, and $\\phi$ is calculated. Cassandra uses\nexponential distribution as an approximation for determining $\\phi$. The\noriginal $\\phi$-Accrual Failure Detection Algorithm used Gaussian distribution.\n\n### Scaling\n\nWhenever a new node joins the system, its token is generated such that it falls\nwithin the range of an existing heavily loaded node. This results in the new\nnode splitting the range of the old node. The old node transfers some of its\ndata to the new node using kernel-kernel copying techniques.\n\n### Local Persistence\n\nCassandra uses a commit log as well as an in-memory data structure to store the\ndata. Each write is first committed to the commit log. Only after successful\nwrite into the commit log, the data is saved in the in-memory data structure.\nWhen the in-memory data structure crosses a predefined threshold, it is dumped\nto the disk along with an index file for fast lookups. A merge process runs\nperiodically to merge these disk files.\n\nA read operation first queries the in-memory store. If data is not found there,\nthen a disk lookup is required. To avoid looking into multiple files, a bloom\nfilter, summarizing the keys in the file, is also used. The bloom filter can\nalso be used to check the key existence.\n\nPaper Link:-\n[Cassandra - A Decentralized Structured Storage System](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/ladis2009/papers/Lakshman-ladis2009.PDF)\n",

      "content_html": "\nLast week, while reading the book\n[Designing data-intensive applications](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34646879-designing-data-intensive-applications),\nI came across the term \"Gossip Protocols.\" The title was quite intriguing; hence\nI search for it on Google. It turns out that it is a communication protocol. It\nis sometimes also called the \"Epidemic Protocol.\"\n\nWe are facing an ongoing pandemic called COVID-19. The term \"Epidemic Protocol\"\ncaught my attention, and I started wondering how the knowledge of epidemics is\ngoing to be useful in computer systems. It turns out; these protocols try to\nemulate the spread of a virus to effectively communicate the information to all\nnodes in a distributed network.\n\nA virus spread quickly and robustly. Our goal in a distributed system is to\nspread the information/updates as quickly as possible without burdening the\nnetwork. The epidemic protocols try to bring these ideas from epidemiology to\ndistributed systems.\n\nI use both terms (Gossip and Epidemic) interchangeably in this post.\n\n## Analogy to a real epidemic\n\nLet' take a close look at how a virus spreads. I'll explain it using a small\nsample of five people. We assume that, initially, none of these people is\ninfected. Now, because of some external factors, one of these (say $A$) got\ninfected with the virus. We say that $A$ is **_infected_**, and the remaining\nfour people are **_susceptible_** to infection. $A$ followed the advice of\ndoctors and isolated itself from the group. Now we say that $A$ is **_removed_**\n(either because he has the infection, but is not spreading it, or because he is\nrecovered).\n\nNow, let's extend this analogy to a network. In a network, we have multiple\nnodes. These nodes are classified using the terms -- infected, susceptible, and\nremoved. The infected nodes try to spread some information by periodically\nselecting some peer nodes from the network. If a node is susceptible, that is,\nit does not know the said information, then after the selection and transmission\nof information by an infected node, the susceptible node also gets infected and\nstarts spreading the information. A node is said to be removed, if it already\nknows the said information, but is not spreading it because, for example, all\nits peers already know the information, so there is no need to keep spreading it\n-- the so-called herd immunity).\n\n## Some theory\n\nThe concept of the Gossip Protocol is not something new. The 1987\n[paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/41840.41841) Epidemic algorithms for\nreplicated database maintenance is considered seminal on this topic. The Gossip\nProtocols were initially used to maintain consistency in replicated databases\nfor efficient data communication. Later, these protocols found their usage in\nother areas such as service discovery in a distributed environment and\nmaintaining node memberships as well.\n\nUsually, these protocols work as follows -\n\n1. A node ($A$) in the network randomly selects another node with which it wants\n   to share information. Here, the assumption is that each node in the network\n   either maintains a list of all the other nodes or gets the information from a\n   centralized server.\n2. On receipt of information, the receiving node ($B$) processes the\n   information.\n3. In the next round of this process, both $A$ and $B$ again select nodes\n   randomly and transmit the information.\n4. These steps repeat periodically until the information is disseminated to\n   every node in the network.\n\n## Methods\n\nIn the paper mentioned above, two schemes of epidemic protocols were analyzed -\n\n### Anti-entropy\n\nIn this scheme, a node $p$ randomly contacts a random partner $q$ from the\ncurrent population. The nodes $p$ and $q$ engage in information exchange to\nresolve any differences between them. The updates known to $p$ but not known to\n$q$ are transferred using different strategies (push, pull, and push-pull).\n\nAs it turns out, anti-entropy requires significant network bandwidth, because it\nneeds to send the complete database contents to other nodes for resolving any\ndifferences. There are many approaches, such as sharing checksums, Merkel trees,\nmaintaining a recent update list, etc. that can be used to reduce the bandwidth\nrequirements in the anti-entropy algorithm. These strategies allow the sending\nnode to know what updates the receiving nodes require to become consistent.\n\nIt can be proven that this algorithm guarantees the eventual dissemination of\ninformation. The number of updates sent in this scheme is not bounded, so there\nis no termination.\n\nThis scheme is equivalent to the SI model (simple epidemic) from epidemiology.\nThe term SI stands for susceptible-infected (same as explained above). A node is\nalways susceptible or infected.\n\n### Rumor mongering\n\nAs the name suggests, this scheme works similarly to how rumors spread.\nInitially, all nodes are ignorant of a rumor. When a node learns about some\nupdates, it becomes a \"hot rumor.\" While a node holds a hot rumor, it\nperiodically chooses another node at random and pushes the rumor to the other\nsite. When a node has tried to share a hot rumor with too many nodes that have\nalready seen it, the node stops treating the rumor as hot and retains the update\nwithout propagating it further. Rumor-mongering requires very less network\nbandwidth because it needs to send only recent updates to other nodes.\n\nThe equivalent of this in epidemiology is the SIR model (complex epidemic),\nwhich stands for susceptible-infected-removed. A node can be susceptible or\ninfected or removed.\n\nBecause of the removal of nodes, the number of messages transmitted in this\nalgorithm is bounded. However, because of this, there is a slight chance that\nsome updates might not reach all nodes. So it does not guarantee eventual\nconsistency.\n\nThere are two strategies to decide when a node should be removed -\n{/* TODO: - Random - Removed with probability $\\frac{1}{k}$ after each unsuccessful attempt. */}\n{/* TODO: - Counter - Removed after $k$ unnecessary contacts. */}\n\nThe analysis of gossip algorithms focuses on designing strategies on how to\nselect the best peer group to share the information with.\n\nIf you want to get started with this topic, here I recommend some papers that\nare quite fundamental when it comes to an understanding of how gossiping works:\n\n1. [Epidemic Algorithms For Replicated Database Maintenance](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/41840.41841)\n2.

[A gossip protocol simulator](https://flopezluis.github.io/gossip-simulator/)\n\n---\n\n**P.S.** - This is my first attempt to read and summarize CS research papers. I\nhave intentionally covered only a small part (first few pages) of the paper\n(first reference in the above list) here, as I am still figuring out the best\nway to read and summarise. I am confident that with time and practice, I will\nget better.\n\nIf you find any scope of improvement in current content, please let me know\nthrough email or comment box below.\n",

      "content_html": "\nIt has been three months since 2020 started. I was not able to keep up with my\nyearly habit of posting year reviews due to some reasons. One primary reason\nbehind my negligence is my disinterest in writing on this blog. I felt that it\nwas because the old layout of this blog had been too recurrent for me. So, I\ndecided to fix that issue before thinking about writing.\n\nThe year 2019 was not a great year for me on many fronts. It was a year that\nreminded me of my limitations and brought me out of the bubble, that self-help\nbooks created for me. In retrospection, I find that I started a lot of things,\nwith the intention of learning, but couldn't achieve any of the targets.\n\nLike, I structure these posts every year, I have divided this post too in many\nsections. It makes it easier for me to focus on various aspects of my life in\nthe past year. I will start with the best parts of my life.\n\n## Reading\n\nI had decided to read 26 books in the year. I finished the year with 28 books.\nOut of 12 months, I did not read any book in January, November, and December. I\nfinished two of the fiction series that I wanted to read for years - Harry\nPotter, and Percy Jackson. These two books are the reasons that I was able to\nfinish 28 books in 9 months. It took me very little time to finish these book\nseries. Other books (mostly non-fiction) took me ages to complete.\n\nI am not sure if I am getting any value out of non-fiction books _right now_. I\ndo not take notes and forget most of the lessons in a few days. Not sure if this\nis the right strategy while reading such books. Hence I have decided that I will\nreduce the number of non-fiction books _for some time_ and put more attention to\ntechnical publications and CS books.\n\nThough I am confident that my note-taking skills will not help in reading\ntechnical books either, I do hope to improve over time.\n\nOne of my reading goals from last year was to read a research paper every 15\ndays. I succeeded in the first quarter of the year and failed miserably after\nthat. I started with a good intention and kept reading for some months. Then\nself-doubts began popping out. _What value am I getting out of this?_, was the\nquestion in my mind. I started this exercise because I have specific goals in my\nmind, and I wanted to improve myself academically. But when you are not able to\nanswer such a question even to yourself, then something is wrong.\n\nThis failure has taught me some crucial lessons. I tend to start things without\nthinking about the end goal. It is the right approach when _learnings_ from the\nprocess is more important than the result. But I was not able to focus on either\nof them. I lost my focus when I realized this.\n\nI have come to understand the value of proper note-taking. I have read so many\ngood books, but I do not remember any lessons from these books, because -\n\n- I read passively and try to finish the book as quickly as possible.\n- I did not try to implement the lessons in my day to day life while reading.\n\nI lost my interest in reading news and blog articles also. I lost my interest\nfrom social media and, in general, the Internet entirely. I preferred to sleep\nas much as possible. That has its side-effects. Read on.\n\n## Blogging and Writing\n\nI had decided to write regularly in 2019. I didn't. It seems that failing was a\nnorm for me in 2019. This section was my worst hit interest in 2019. Somehow, I\nwas not able to gather the concentration required for writing. I used to get\nsudden motivations for a few days, I wrote during those periods. The rest of the\ntime, I just thought that I should write. I think I suffered from the so-called\n_Writer's Block_.\n\n## Health\n\nMy analysis says that all my failures last year can be traced to this section. I\nwas sick for almost a quarter of the year. Repeatedly getting ill and the time\nrequired for recovery took a toll on my body and mind. I lost all my focus and\nwill power to do anything.\n\nThe exercise was again an issue. I certainly put more effort than last year, but\nthat effort was scattered throughout the year, for small periods. So, I do not\nnotice much difference. However, I continued to walk whenever I got time.\n\n## Work\n\nIt was not a very exciting year on the work front. I continued to work in Cisco\nthis year. The work was neither very interesting nor very dull. The nature of my\njob is such that the exciting work shows up from time to time. With no fixed\ndeadlines and no fixed way of doing things, it can be quite satisfying and quite\nfrustrating at times.\n\n## Social Media\n\nI lost my interest in social media altogether. I opened Facebook only to see the\nnotification once in a while, sometimes after months. I got disillusioned by\nTwitter this year, because of the toxic political content there. I was never a\nregular user of YouTube anyway, so that was never a concern. However, I went to\ngreat lengths to delete every Google app from my phone, especially Gmail and\nYouTube. The email had become a new Facebook for me. I was checking emails every\n15 minutes. So I signed out of Google account in my primary browser and\nrestricted my email activities to a secondary browser. It helped me in keeping\nthe urge to check email in control.\n\nBut this sudden disinterest has created a void in my typical day, which is quite\nreasonable given how much my life depends on the Internet. I am yet to figure\nout how to fill this void. Reading books did not help, however sleeping and\nwatching movies helped for sure (however, not without its own set of problems).\n\n## Travel\n\nI was somewhat dissatisfied with myself for not traveling enough. This year, I\nhad decided to travel extensively. But my health betrayed me. Out of 365 days, I\nwas able to take the time of 4 days for travel. I went to Coorg and Chikmagalur\nwith friends. Both trips happened during the wrong weather conditions. But the\ncircumstances were such that I could not deny to my friends.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nMy daily routine, more or less, remained the same. Though I couldn't wake up\nearly in the morning most of the time, the reality is that I was not trying. My\nonly intention behind waking up early in the morning was to meditate. I did\nthat, however sporadically.\n\nOne other goal in 2019 was to get rid of procrastination. I did not care about\nit at all. Somehow, I was too busy fixing other issues in my life, that this\nseemed like a minor problem. Anyway, I did not attempt to do anything on a\npersonal level, where procrastination would affect me. On the work front, at one\npoint or another, you have to work and show results. So there it was never\napparent. I tried many things to reduce the impact and influence of _technology_\nin my life. Although I consider myself successful to an extent, there is still\nscope for improvement.\n\nIn 2018, I was in full praise for to-do lists and the concept of maintaining\ngoals. 2019 has busted all those praises. This year, these techniques did not\nwork for me at all. Anyway, 2019 was one of those times when nothing worked for\nme, so this failure does not come as a surprise to me. Though, I still believe\nthat this is something that can genuinely help me with some of my issues.\n\n---\n\n_If I had written this post at the beginning of the year 2020, I would have\nwritten some wish for the year 2020 at this place, as I always do, but this time\nis so gloomy that I am not able to think of anything good. I just pray to God\nthat everything gets all right soon._\n\n_Being with family during this time, has given me some mental stability. But, it\nis also true that facing such circumstances and coming out triumphant, is what\nshows the human character._\n",

      "content_html": "\nBefore I start, here is some technical information about my website -\n\n- Hosted on Gitlab and usage its CD for automatic deployment, which is triggered\n  on a git commit.\n- The domain name registrar is GoDaddy.\n- Let's Encrypt as the TLS certificate provider for my domain name.\n\nLet's Encrypt provides certificates for 90 days only, so I was forced to set up\nthe `certbot` every three months, then generate the certificate and _manually_\ndeploy the certificates to GitLab. It was frustrating because in three months,\nmy shell probably will not remember the command I used last time, and I was too\nlazy to document the process somewhere.\n\nThen I came across a [project](https://github.com/pallavagarwal07/NamesiloCert),\nwhich was trying to do a similar thing with other domain name registrar. I\nthought that this is an excellent setup to adapt and modify it to suit my needs.\nSo I decided to write my module for automatic deployment of Let's Encrypt\ncertificates to GitLab.\n\n## How does Let's Encrypt work?\n\nBefore Let's Encrypt can generate the certificate for the domain, it requires\nthe user to prove domain ownership. Let's Encrypt provides two\n[methods](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/) to do this task -\n\n- Updating the DNS records of the domain registrar (DNS-01 challenge)\n- Adding an HTTP resource under a well-known URI on the website (HTTP-01\n  challenge)\n\nUsing the second method requires me to add a file on my website, and I did not\nwant to do that. Moreover, if in the future, I decide to host some other\nservice, which does not have a website, then this method will fail.\n\nThe first method requires that the domain configuration on the domain registrar\nis modified. GoDaddy provides a robust API, and it is not difficult to utilize\nthat API to automate specific tasks. The probability of changing the registrar\nis quite low, at least for the next few years. It will be easier to generate the\ncertificates for any subdomains, as all the subdomains will also be hosted under\nthe same domain registrar.\n\n## How does the tool work?\n\nSo here are the steps:\n\n1. Call `certbot` with all the domain names\n2. Invoke GoDaddy API to update the DNS records as indicated by Certbot\n3. Wait for 10 minutes for DNS changes to propagate\n4. Let `certbot` verify the DNS changes\n5. Use the GitLab API to deploy the generated certificates to GitLab pages\n\n### Step 1: Invoking certbot\n\nIn step 1, we call `certbot` will the preferred method DNS. We also need to\nsupply an email id (used by Let's Encrypt to notify domain expiration). The\n`EMAIL_ID` environment variable can be used to store the email id of the user.\n\nCertbot runs in an interactive mode by default. It is not desired in a scripted\nenvironment. Certbot also provides mechanisms to deploy the certificates to a\nlocal server automatically, but as we are hosting our website on Gitlab, we do\nnot want the automatic deployment facility. So we need to invoke the `certbot`\ncommand with `--manual` and `certonly` modes.\n\n```bash\ncertbot   --manual \\\n          --preferred-challenges dns \\\n          --agree-tos \\\n          --email \"${EMAIL_ID}\" \\\n          --no-eff-email \\\n          --expand \\\n          --renew-by-default \\\n          --manual-public-ip-logging-ok \\\n          --noninteractive \\\n          --redirect \\\n          --config-dir ${DIR}/generated/config \\\n          --work-dir ${DIR}/generated/work \\\n          --logs-dir ${DIR}/generated/logs \\\n          --manual-auth-hook ${DIR}/auth_hook.sh \\\n          -d yashagarwal.in \\\n          certonly\n```\n\nThe explanation for most of the flags used in the above command can be found by\nrunning the following command -\n\n```bash\ncertbot --help\n```\n\nThe `--manual-auth-hook` flag is worth looking. This hook provides a mechanism\nto specify the executable, which can be used to facilitate domain ownership\nvalidation. In this case, the hook points to a script `auth_hook.sh`, which then\ncalls a Go client, which interacts with GoDaddy API.\n\n### Step 2: Adding DNS entry to GoDaddy DNS manager\n\nCertbot supplies two environment variables `CERTBOT_DOMAIN`, which contains the\ndomain name to be verified and `CERTBOT_VALIDATION`, which includes a random\nstring corresponding to `_acme-challenge TXT` entry. What this means is that, if\nI have\n\n```text\nCERTBOT_DOMAIN=yashagarwal.in\nCERTBOT_VALIDATION=6VNg5kDVI_BF1S9N5s74LTBHQnwDpQqKlblKRjIzBwM\n```\n\nThen the DNS manager should contain a TXT entry `_acme-challenge.yashagarwal.in`\nwith the value of `6VNg5kDVI_BF1S9N5s74LTBHQnwDpQqKlblKRjIzBwM`.\n\nThe `auth_hook.sh` file calls the Go client with the abovementioned environment\nvariables. The relevant code can be found\n[here](https://github.com/yashhere/GoDaddy-GitLab-Certs/blob/master/auth_hook.sh).\n\nOnce all the DNS entries are added, the `auth_hook.sh` script will sleep for 10\nminutes. It is to allow DNS changes to propagate throughout the Internet. It is\na random duration as I could not find any GoDaddy support page mentioning the\nexact period used by them.\n\n### Step 3: Generation of certificates\n\nOnce the `auth_hook.sh` script returns successfully, `certbot` will verify the\nDNS records. If the verification is successful, `certbot` will generate the\ncertificates in `./generated/config/live/{CERTBOT_DOMAIN}` directory.\n\n### Step 4: Deploying the certificates to GitLab\n\nI use the following command to deploy the certificates to Gitlab pages where my\nwebsite is hosted -\n\n```bash\ncurl  -vvv \\\n      --request PUT \\\n      --header \"Private-Token:${GITLAB_TOKEN}\" \\\n      --form \"certificate=@${key_dir}/fullchain.pem\" \\\n      --form \"key=@${key_dir}/privkey.pem\" \\ \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/yashhere%2Fyashhere.gitlab.io/pages/domains/yashagarwal.in\"\n```\n\nwhere\n\n```bash\nkey_dir=\"./generated/config/live/yashagarwal.in\"\n```\n\nMoreover, `GITLAB_TOKEN` is an environment variable that contains the API token\ngenerated from the Gitlab settings page.\n\n## Automatic Deployment using Travis CI\n\nIt is not automation if I have to run this script manually every three months.\nSo I created a Travis CI job to automate this process. The job will run every\nmonth and deploy my certificates automatically. It has been four months, and I\nhave not faced any issues with this setup.\n\nThe code for this post can be viewed at\n[Github](https://github.com/yashhere/GoDaddy-GitLab-Certs).\n\nThanks for reading.

      "content_html": "\nRecently, I am experimenting with Web Application Firewalls a lot. ModSecurity\nis one of them. It is the most famous and useful open-source Web Application\nFirewall (WAF) in existence. It is supported by various web servers such as\nApache, Nginx, and IIS.\n\nThe job of ModSecurity is to sit in front of the application web server and\ncheck the incoming requests and outgoing responses to filter out malicious\ncontent. It does so by the use of powerful and complex regular expressions.\nModSecurity uses a rule language for its rules. The rule language has variables\nand operators defined to aid in the process of parsing HTTP requests.\n\nModSecurity, in itself, cannot block or allow requests. It is just a rule\nengine. It requires rules to operate appropriately. That's where its sister\nproject, Core Rule Set (CRS), comes into the picture. CRS is a rule set\ndeveloped to be used with ModSecurity. It has been in active development for\nseveral years now and is very mature. Together, ModSecurity and CRS form a\nformidable defense against the widespread web application attacks.\n\nNow that you know, what a WAF is, let's proceed to install ModSecurity on\nUbuntu. I will be compiling ModSecurity's latest version on Ubuntu 18.04. We\nwill also configure ModSecurity to use Core Rule Set.\n\n## Installing Dependencies\n\nModSecurity requires some dependencies to work correctly. Let's install them -\n\nFirst, upgrade the Ubuntu system.\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get -y update\nsudo apt-get -y upgrade\n```\n\nNow install the dependencies.\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get -y install git libtool dh-autoreconf pkgconf gawk libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev libpcre3-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libyajl-dev zlibc zlib1g-dev libxml2 libpcre++-dev libxml2-dev libgeoip-dev liblmdb-dev lua5.2-dev iputils-ping locales apache2 apache2-dev ca-certificates wget\n```\n\n_Optional_: clean up the Ubuntu caches.\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get clean && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n```\n\nInstall `SSDeep` as well (as done\n[here](https://github.com/coreruleset/modsecurity-docker/blob/bf60dcb29fad101c5b90edf272909742e4e85929/v2-apache/Dockerfile))\n\n```sh\ncd ~\ngit clone https://github.com/ssdeep-project/ssdeep\ncd ssdeep\n./bootstrap\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\n## Compiling ModSecurity\n\nLet's clone ModSecurity from Github.\n\n```sh\ncd ~\ngit clone -b v3/master --single-branch https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity\ncd ModSecurity\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n./build.sh\n./configure\nmake                # takes ~8 minutes on AWS t2.micro\nsudo make install\n```\n\n## Compiling ModSecurity-apache connector\n\nTo configure it with Apache, we will require ModSecurity-apache connector. Let's\ninstall that as well.\n\n```sh\ncd ~\ngit clone https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity-apache\ncd ModSecurity-apache\n./autogen.sh\n./configure --with-libmodsecurity=/usr/local/modsecurity\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\n## Setting up CRS rules\n\nNow, let's download CRS rule set as well.\n\n```sh\ncd ~\ngit clone -b v3.2/dev https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs\nsudo mv owasp-modsecurity-crs/ /usr/local/\n```\n\nRename CRS configuration file -\n\n```sh\nsudo mv /usr/local/owasp-modsecurity-crs/crs-setup.conf.example /usr/local/owasp-modsecurity-crs/crs-setup.conf\n```\n\n## Setting up ModSecurity\n\nNow, we need to create a file in the Apache modules directory, so that Apache\ncan know, how to activate ModSecurity.\n\nCreate `/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/security3.conf` file and paste the following\ncontents -\n\n```apache\nLoadModule security3_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_security3.so\nmodsecurity on\nmodsecurity_rules_file '/etc/apache2/modsec/main.conf'\n```\n\nAs you can see, the last line in the above code block reference a file\n`main.conf` in a folder `modsec`. This folder will not be present by default. We\nneed to create that.\n\n```sh\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/apache2/modsec\n```\n\nSetup ModSecurity configuration file -\n\n```sh\n# enables Unicode support in ModSecurity\nsudo wget -P /etc/apache2/modsec/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/v3/master/unicode.mapping\n\nsudo wget -P /etc/apache2/modsec/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/v3/master/modsecurity.conf-recommended\nsudo mv /etc/apache2/modsec/modsecurity.conf-recommended /etc/apache2/modsec/modsecurity.conf\n```\n\nChange the SecRuleEngine directive in the configuration to change from the\ndefault \"detection only\" mode to actively dropping malicious traffic.\n\n```sh\nsudo sed -i 's/SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly/SecRuleEngine On/' /etc/apache2/modsec/modsecurity.conf\n```\n\nChange the location of `modsec_audit.log` file to Apache log directory.\n\n```sh\nsudo sed -i 's/SecAuditLog \\/var\\/log\\/modsec_audit.log/SecAuditLog \\/var\\/log\\/apache2\\/modsec_audit.log/' /etc/apache2/modsec/modsecurity.conf\n```\n\nTo configure ModSecurity to use CRS rule set, put the following text in\n`/etc/apache2/modsec/main.conf` file.\n\n```apache\nInclude \"/etc/apache2/modsec/modsecurity.conf\"\nInclude \"/usr/local/owasp-modsecurity-crs/crs-setup.conf\"\nInclude \"/usr/local/owasp-modsecurity-crs/rules/*.conf\"\n```\n\nAlso enable some Apache modules for better functioning of ModSecurity.\n\n```sh\nsudo a2enmod unique_id headers rewrite actions dav dav_fs\n```\n\nNow restart the Apache server\n\n```sh\nsudo systemctl restart apache2\n```\n\n## Fixing some common issues\n\nSometimes, I had encountered errors when ModSecurity was not able to append logs\nto its log file. I figured out that ModSecurity did not have enough permissions\nto write that file. We can fix this issue quickly.\n\nFirst, test if you really have this issue or not.\n\n```html\n$ curl 'http://localhost/?q=\">\n<script>\n  alert(1)\n</script>\n'\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>403 Forbidden</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Forbidden</h1>\n    <p>You dont have permission to access / on this server.<br /></p>\n    <hr />\n    <address>Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu) Server at localhost Port 80</address>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNow go to Apache log directory and check the contents of `modsec_audit.log`\nfile.\n\n```sh\ncd /var/log/apache2\ntail modsec_audit.log\n```\n\nYou should see the following content -\n\n```text\n---0LzdyETA---A--\n[01/Jul/2019:14:42:41 +0000] 156199216179.666171 127.0.0.1 41824 ip-xxx-xx-xx-xx.ap-south-1.compute.internal 80\n---0LzdyETA---B--\nGET /?q=\"><script>alert(1)</script> HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\nUser-Agent: curl/7.58.0\nAccept: */*\n\n---TqjMwy7h---D--\n\n---TqjMwy7h---F--\nHTTP/1.1 403\n\n---TqjMwy7h---H--\nModSecurity: Warning. detected XSS using libinjection. [file \"/usr/local/owasp-modsecurity-crs/rules/REQUEST-941-APPLICATION-ATTACK-XSS.conf\"] [line \"37\"] [id \"941100\"] [rev \"\"] [msg \"XSS Attack Detected via libinjection\"] [data \"Matched Data: XSS data found within ARGS:q: \"><script>alert(1)</script>\"] [severity \"2\"] [ver \"OWASP_CRS/3.1.0\"] [maturity \"0\"] [accuracy \"0\"] [tag \"application-multi\"] [tag \"language-multi\"] [tag \"platform-multi\"] [tag \"attack-xss\"] [tag \"OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/XSS\"] [tag \"WASCTC/WASC-8\"] [tag \"WASCTC/WASC-22\"] [tag \"OWASP_TOP_10/A3\"] [tag \"OWASP_AppSensor/IE1\"] [tag \"CAPEC-242\"] [hostname \"localhost\"] [uri \"/\"] [unique_id \"156198848361.198287\"] [ref \"v8,27t:utf8toUnicode,t:urlDecodeUni,t:htmlEntityDecode,t:jsDecode,t:cssDecode,t:removeNulls\"]\n....\n....\n\n---TqjMwy7h---I--\n\n---TqjMwy7h---J--\n\n---TqjMwy7h---Z--\n```\n\nIf you do not see the following content, and the file is empty or it does not\nexist, then ModSecurity was not able to open this file for writing. Use the\nfollowing fix -\n\n```sh\n# find out the user, Apache is running as\napache_user=\"$(ps -ef | egrep '(httpd|apache2|apache)' | grep -v `whoami` | grep -v root | head -n1 | awk '{print $1}')\"\n```\n\nAdd this user to `adm` group which owns the Apache logs directory in Ubuntu.\n\n```sh\nsudo usermod -G adm www-data\n```\n\nNow, change the owner of Apache log directory to `apache_user`.\n\n```sh\nsudo chown -R $apache_user:$apache_user /var/log/apache2/*\n```\n\nNow, ModSecurity should be able to append logs to the file `modsec_audit.log`.\n\n## _Bonus_: Enabling JSON logs\n\n**Note:** Honestly speaking, I was not able to make it work every time. I do not\nknow what is the issue, but it works with some of the installations, and with\nsome of the installations, it just doesn't log anything to the `audit`\ndirectory. If anyone has managed to make it work consistently, please let me\nknow.\n\n**Edit (13/07/2020):** The JSON logging works fine. The issue was that\nModSecurity did not have permission to create subdirectories in the Apache log\ndirectory. I suppose it is something related to SELinux. However, a simple\nsolution is to add the user under which the Apache process runs to the `adm`\ngroup. It might not be the right solution security-wise. However, from a quick\nremediation point of view, it works. Please let me know if you identify any\nbetter solution to fix the problem.\n\nAnyway, if you are like me, who do not like the default ModSecurity log format,\nModSecurity provides an option to generate logs in JSON format as well. To\nenable JSON support, the YAJL library should be installed. We already installed\nthis package when we were installing dependencies, so our ModSecurity setup is\ncompiled with JSON support. Let us now configure ModSecurity to generate JSON\nlogs.\n\nOpen the `/etc/apache2/modsec/modsecurity.conf` file and find the following\nlines -\n\n```apache\nSecAuditLogType           Serial\nSecAuditLog               /var/log/modsec_audit.log\n```\n\nOnce you have found the following lines, replace these lines with the following\nlines\n\n```apache\nSecAuditLogFormat         JSON\nSecAuditLogType           Parallel\nSecAuditLog               /var/log/apache2/modsec_audit.log\nSecAuditLogStorageDir     /var/log/apache2/audit/\n\nSecAuditLogFileMode       0644\nSecAuditLogDirMode        0755\n```\n\nRestart Apache server\n\n```sh\nsudo systemctl restart apache2\n```\n\nNow, go to `/var/log/apache2/` directory and create `audit` folder.\n\n```sh\nsudo usermod -G adm $apache_user\n\ncd /var/log/apache2\nsudo mkdir audit\n\n# make `apache_user` owner of this directory as well...\nsudo chown -R $apache_user:$apache_user /var/log/apache2/audit\n```\n\nNow, ModSecurity should be able to generate JSON logs in this directory.\nModSecurity generates logs in the following format -\n\n```sh\nubuntu@server:/var/log/apache2$ tree audit\naudit\n└── 20190701\n    ├── 20190701-1132\n    │   ├── 20190701-113225-156196094515.868593\n    │   └── 20190701-113226-156196094691.154769\n    ├── 20190701-1211\n    │   ├── 20190701-121122-156196328239.048942\n    │   └── 20190701-121122-156196328243.018882\n\n    ....\n    ....\n```\n\nNow, your site should be relatively more secure than before.\n\n## A warning, though\n\nCRS is known to generate a lot of false-positive when enabled completely. We\nhave not touched CRS paranoia levels. By default, it is set to paranoia level 1,\nwhich is known to produce false positives rarely, but still, as a measure of\nprecaution, monitor your site's traffic for some time, and then decide if you\nneed to disable some of the CRS rules or not.\n",

      "content_html": "\nSouth India is blessed with nature throughout the year, but monsoons bring a\ndifferent flavor and ethereal quality to some places. Although the rainy season\nmight not be the best time to travel, there is a certain charm in holidaying\nduring the downpour.\n\nWe (I and my flatmates in Bengaluru) were planning a trip to Chikmagalur since\nthe beginning of June. One of my friends knows driving, so we decided to rent a\ncar and drive ourselves to a distance of approximately 250 KMs. We booked the\ncar through Drivezy. They had promised a Mahindra KUV100, but at the last\nmoment, that couldn't keep their commitment and gave us a Honda Amaze with\nautomatic transmission. My friend who was driving had never driven such a car,\nso we all got scared of our fate for the next two days, but we decided to go\nahead with it, trusting our friend.\n\n_I too know driving, but like every other aspect of my life, I never gained\nenough confidence to go on such a long drive. It was a similar case this time as\nwell._\n\nThe way to Chikmagalur from Bengaluru is the well-maintained NH75 (it has a\ntotal of four tolls, so maintenance is expected). We started early on the\nmorning of Saturday, 22nd June to avoid Bengaluru's traffic. Nature was\naccommodating that day, and the Sun 🌞 stayed hidden behind clouds for most of\nour journey. That made our 6-hour drive very enjoyable.\n\n![Somewhere on NH75](/images/posts/2019-06-29/bdiyaFI.jpg \"Somewhere on NH75\")\n\nWe were not in any hurry and wanted to enjoy every moment of our trip to the\nfullest. With Punjabi beats playing in our car, we stopped at various places on\nthe highway.\n\n> Chikmagalur means \"The town of the younger daughter\" in the Kannada. The town\n> is said to have been given as a dowry to the younger daughter of Rukmangada,\n> the legendary chief of Sakkarepatna and hence the name.\n\nWe stopped at Adyar Ananda Bhavan 🏨 for breakfast. I have tasted sweets from\nA2B, and the taste was the best that I could get in the South. So I decided to\neat Masala Dosai and Idli Sambhar there. The food did not disappoint me at all.\n\nAfter breakfast, we resumed our journey. The first stop in our trip was the\ngorgeous Sri Chennakeshava Temple. _Chenna_ means beautiful and _Keshava_ refers\nto Lord Vishnu. That should give you an idea, the presiding deity of the temple\nis the _Handsome Vishnu_.\n\nThe whole premises of the temple is filled with sheer poetry on the walls in the\nform of stone sculptures. I was completely mesmerized by its intricate but\naesthetically pleasing carvings.\n\nOn the entrance of the temple, a vast golden Gopuram welcomes the devotees. I\nwas amazed by the level of details on the sculptures engraved on the Gopuram. My\nphone's camera will not be able to do justice to this intricate artistry.\n\n![The Gopuram of Sri Chennakeshava Temple](/images/posts/2019-06-29/V6AAfuv.jpg \"The Gopuram of Sri Chennakeshava Temple\")\n\nThe one specialty of the main temple is that it does not feature a dome. I have\nnot seen any major Hindu temple without a dome over the idol of the main deity.\nIt seems like an aberration to me, but a welcoming one. A disclaimer, I am not\nan architecture buff, so I do not know how correct my facts are here.\n\nThe inside of the temple is pretty dark. There are several pillars inside the\ntemple. Each of the pillars is decorated with various types of sculptors.\n\n![A pillar inside the temple](/images/posts/2019-06-29/jhqoSTE.jpg \"A pillar inside the temple\")\n\nHowever, the fascinating thing is at the ceiling. The carvings done on the\nceiling of the temple is just amazing.\n\n![The ceiling of the temple](/images/posts/2019-06-29/074g3uO.jpg \"The ceiling of the temple\")\n\nAs I mentioned above, I am not an architecture buff, so I would not be able to\nwrite a lot about the architecture of the temple. However, enjoy some more\nphotos.\n\n![A Ganesha statue](/images/posts/2019-06-29/KknscQQ.jpg \"A Ganesha statue\")\n\n![Carvings on walls](/images/posts/2019-06-29/jb3McxQ.jpg \"Carvings on walls\")\n\n![Temple](/images/posts/2019-06-29/WQGjwur.jpg \"Temple\")\n\n![Another temple](/images/posts/2019-06-29/jUYDuQd.jpg \"Another temple\")\n\nAfter this temple, we continued our journey to Chikmagalur. We had booked a\nhomestay option. The name of the homestay was Sunshine Palm Retreat, if I recall\ncorrectly. It was one of the best stays I have experienced on any trip till now.\nIt was not crowded, the staff was co-operative, and the ambiance was excellent.\n\n![The Silver Palm Retreat Homestay](/images/posts/2019-06-29/JUTwVEN.jpg \"The Silver Palm Retreat Homestay\")\n\nOn the evening of Saturday, we decided to go for our second destination of the\nday - the so-called _shooting point_. When we searched on Google maps, we found\none location with a similar name. We started driving in that direction. However,\nit turned out that we were going to the wrong place. We tried asking locals, but\nlanguage was an issue. Most of the signboards are also in Kannada only. Somehow\nwe ended up getting on the right track and reached the correct location on time.\nAfter reaching there, Google Maps shows that the place is called Bagmane Sunrise\nPoint. Even this name does not seem to be right.\n\nAs soon we reached there, I realized that all the efforts that we put in\nreaching there were worthwhile. It was an open ground area on top of a small\nhill at one end of a small village. I started roaming here and there, enjoying\nthe serenity of nature. I am not a very photogenic person, so I prefer to click\npictures of objects and nature more than standing in front of a camera at\ndifferent angles.\n\n![A view at shooting point](/images/posts/2019-06-29/c84g6tX.jpg \"A view at shooting point\")\n\nWe spent around 1.5 hours there and then came back.\n[India vs. Afghanistan](https://www.cricbuzz.com/live-cricket-scorecard/20264/ind-vs-afg-match-28-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019)\ncricket match was live on TV, and we fixed ourselves in front of the TV for the\nnext 4 hours. India somehow won that match. Thank God!\n\nThe next day, it was raining from the early morning. We did not want to take any\nrisk by driving on the steep and narrow zig-zag roads. So we dropped our plan to\ngo to Butter Milk Waterfalls and instead decided to go to Mullayanagiri peaks as\nour last destination. We again lost our way, but somehow managed to reach the\nplace.\n\nIt was drizzling there. However, we were at such a high altitude that we had to\nbring our sweaters out. Surprisingly, I found vendors selling Maggi there. I was\nnot expecting the taste to be good, but I was wrong. For that sort of place, the\nMaggi was delicious.\n\n{/* TODO: {{< youtube F9SpC8nFF0A >}} */}\n\nDespite the weather conditions, we decided to climb to the top of the hill. As\nwe were going up, the weather was turning more and bleaker. Out of five of us,\nonly three managed to reach the top, including me. The view from the top of the\nhill was just amazing. Wherever I saw, I saw just the mountain mist. My clothes\nwere wet, and my spectacles were completely covered in fog.\n\n![An inscription](/images/posts/2019-06-29/WSP3EE6.jpg \"An inscription\")\n\nI shot a video when we were coming down from the hilltop.\n\n{/* TODO: {{< youtube So_UD2tpRic  >}} */}\n\n<br />\n\n---\n\nTo summarise, the timing of this trip was not appropriate, but I do not regret\nit. I have gone to other hill stations after the monsoons get over, but it is a\ndifferent experience altogether to go in a rainy season. Chikmagalur is worth\nmore than one visit. Do try to go at an appropriate time if you want to visit\nmore places.\n\nThanks for reading. Cheers :smile:\n",

We will solve\n> this problem using OPA in the next and last post of this series.\n\nLet's solve this issue now. We will use OPA's declarative language, Rego, to\nimplement policies which will decide on the basis of some user-provided data,\nwhich all objects are to be returned to the user.\n\nWe will also define a list of all the users who are part of this library. Here\nwe are hardcoding this data, as I did not want to waste my time in implementing\na user registration service, but this functionality is not very important from\nour point of view. We will require only one field from this users data - the\n`user_type` field. This field will determine what the access level for the user\nis. We have already added the `access_level` field in the `Book` definition of\nour proto file.\n\nWhen the user wants to search for a particular book, it will provide its\n`user_type` the ISBN of the book to our service. Our service will take that ISBN\nand pass it to the OPA server. OPA server already has the `Book` data and the\n`User` data. Now it has the required ISBN to query the Book data. The Rego\npolicy will query the Book data by ISBN. It will also check for the\n`access_level` condition. Moreover, after this operation, it will return the\nresultant set of books that satisfy both the requirements.\n\nHere is the Rego policy -\n\n```go\npackage library\n\nimport data.books\nimport data.users\nimport input\n\nsearch_books[book] {\n  input.book.isbn:= books[i].isbn\n  input.user.user_type >= books[i].access_level\n  book: books[i]\n}\n\nlist_all_books[books[i]] {\n  input.user.user_type >= books[i].access_level\n}\n```\n\nThe user data is\n[here](https://github.com/yashhere/go-library-service/blob/master/OPA/users.json)\nand the book data is\n[here](https://github.com/yashhere/go-library-service/blob/master/add_books.sh).\n\nA sample `input` request is shown below -\n\n```json\n{\n  \"input\": {\n    \"book\": {\n      \"isbn\": \"1128959038\"\n    },\n    \"user\": {\n      \"user_type\": 3\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `input` is the data that the user is providing. In `search_books` function,\nthe input ISBN is matched with the ISBN of all books one by one. Then the\nresultant set of books is filtered by `user_type` and `access_level` (these two\nfields are essentially the same). In the last, the resultant set of books is\nassigned to the variable `book` which will be returned to the gRPC service.\n\nThe `list_all_books` function is implemented similarly. The only difference is\nthat we do not need to filter the books by ISBN. Filtering by `access_level` is\nenough.\n\nNow our library service is completed. It is a very basic service. The intention\nwas to show that the decision-making process can be offloaded to the OPA to\nreduce the complexity of the services. In this example, the advantages might not\nbe obvious, but in large production environments, where many services are\nrunning, it can make a significant difference.\n\nThe code for this series can be found on my\n[Github](https://github.com/yashhere/go-library-service) account.\n\nI hope you liked the article. Share your views and suggestions in the comments.\n\nThanks for reading. Cheers :)\n",

      "content_html": "\nIn the last [post](/blog/go-grpc-opa-a-perfect-union-part-1/), we discussed\nabout the structure of our library application. In this post, we will define the\ndata definitions using protobuf, and then we will use these definitions to\ncreate a Go service. We will also add a REST interface to the service. So let's\nget started.\n\n## Defining Proto Definitions\n\ngRPC uses protocol buffers for serializing structured data. To define the\nstructure of the data that you want to serialize, we use a _proto_ file - it is\na simple text file that contains all the logical pieces of your data in the form\nof _messages_, and the methods that will be called over the network. To know\nmore about the syntax of proto files, visit [this](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/)\nlink.\n\nI have defined the following proto file -\n\n```go\nsyntax: \"proto3\";\npackage library;\nimport \"google/api/annotations.proto\";\n\nservice LibraryService {\n  rpc ListAllBooks(QueryFormat) returns (Books) {\n    option (google.api.http): {\n      post : \"/listBooks\"\n      body : \"*\"\n    };\n  };\n  rpc AddBook(QueryFormat) returns (Response) {\n    option (google.api.http): {\n      post : \"/addBook\"\n      body : \"*\"\n    };\n  };\n  rpc SearchBook(QueryFormat) returns (Response) {\n    option (google.api.http): {\n      post : \"/searchBook\"\n      body : \"*\"\n    };\n  };\n}\n\n// the library\nmessage Library { Books books: 1; }\n\nmessage Books { repeated Book books: 1; }\n\n// metadata about a book\nmessage Book {\n  string title: 1;\n  string author: 2;\n  string isbn: 3;\n  int32 no_of_copies: 5;\n  int32 access_level: 6;\n}\n\n// details about a user\nmessage User {\n  enum UserType {\n    // https://github.com/golang/protobuf/issues/258\n    GARBAGE: 0;\n    Student: 1;\n    Administration: 2;\n    Faculty: 3;\n  }\n\n  string name: 1;\n  int32 id_no: 2;\n  UserType user_type: 4;\n}\n\nmessage QueryFormat {\n  Book book: 1;\n  User user: 2;\n}\n\nmessage Response {\n  string action: 1;\n  int32 status: 2;\n  string message: 3;\n  oneof value {\n    Book book: 4;\n    User user_data: 5;\n  }\n}\n\nmessage Empty {}\n```\n\nTo compile it, run the following commands -\n\n```bash\nprotoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \\\n-I$GOPATH/src \\\n-I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \\\n--go_out=plugins=grpc:. \\\napi/library.proto\n```\n\n```bash\nprotoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \\\n  -I$GOPATH/src \\\n  -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \\\n  --grpc-gateway_out=logtostderr=true:. \\\n  api/library.proto\n```\n\nIt will generate corresponding Golang definitions of the messages and services\ndefined in the Proto file. These definitions can be used by the server and\nclient stubs to communicate with each other.\n\n## Implementation of Go service\n\nNow we can start implementing the code for our services `AddBook()`,\n`ListAllBooks()` and `SearchBook()`. It is going to be a very naive\nimplementation of a library system, but it will be sufficient to learn all the\nconcepts.\n\nMy implementation of the server stub is hosted\n[here](https://github.com/yashhere/go-library-service/blob/master/pkg/librarylib/server.go).\nA basic flow diagram of this implementation will look like this -\n\n![Architecture](/images/posts/OPA_Service_Flow_Diagram.jpeg \"Architecture\")\n\nThe gRPC server will listen on port `:50051`, and a REST HTTP server will listen\non port `:8181`. The OPA server is running on port `:8182`. The REST server is\nimplemented using\n[gRPC-Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway). There are three\nmethods - `AddBook()`, `ListAllBooks()`, and `SearchBook()`. These methods can\nbe called using either gRPC methods or using the REST endpoints `/addBook`,\n`/listBooks` and `/searchBook`. By design, the library gRPC service will not\nimplement the authentication part of the service. The main purpose of using gRPC\nhere is to provide a scalable and secure medium where all the communication\nbetween client and server is happening in binary format, which is slightly more\nsecure than the traditional mediums. In the current form, this gRPC server will\naccept requests from everyone and execute the desired functions. That is not\ndesirable. What if a student tries to add a book to the library. Only Admins\nshould be allowed to execute such functions. What if someone who is not a\nstudent of the University tries to access the service. How to stop them?\n\nThere are two steps to solve this issue -\n\n1. **Authentication** - It mainly deals with the question - who are you? It is a\n   way to gain access to the system by verifying your identity. In our case, a\n   user will provide its username and password to access the library service.\n   Without this authentication, the user will not be able to access the system.\n   We will not be implementing authentication functionality in our application.\n\n2. **Authorization** - It deals with the question - which resources are you\n   allowed to use? OPA can be used here to define various rights based on the\n   access levels of the users.\n\nIf you have noticed, I have defined an `access_level` field in the proto\ndefinition of the `Book`. This field will tell us what is the minimum access\nlevel required for a user to access this book.\n\nAgain, in the proto definition of the `User`, I have defined a `user_type`\nfield. This field will serve as an indicator of the access rights of the user.\nIn the real world, these access rights will be decided after the user has\nauthenticated herself to the system, but here, we will hardcode the access\nrights.\n\nSo, only users with access rights equal to `Administration` will be allowed to\nadd books to the system. Here we do not care who the user is. If the user is\nsupplying the correct access right, she will be allowed to operate. The\nauthentication logic in real-world scenarios will determine the _who_ part.\n\nThere are some books in the library, which have access rights equal to that of a\n`Faculty`. It means that only faculties will be allowed to access those books.\nThe students will not be able to access these books, even while searching for\nbooks using ISBN. This kind of mechanism can be implemented using OPA very\nquickly. We will see the implementation of the OPA part in the next post.\n\nWhile querying the service, users are required to supply their identity (at\nleast `user_type`) and the book ISBN if they are searching for some book. The\nadministrators are supposed to provide the name, author, access level, number of\ncopies, and ISBN while adding the books. I have not added the error checking\nfunctionality in the code, but it should be easy enough to implement such\nfunctionality.\n\nThe\n[main.go](https://github.com/yashhere/go-library-service/blob/master/cmd/main.go)\nfile is the starting point of this service. It will spawn two servers in two Go\nRoutines. Ideally, some synchronization mechanisms should be implemented in the\ncode to avoid race conditions in some cases - for example, what will happen if\ntwo or more clients are trying to add the same book simultaneously. Here in our\ncase, nothing serious will happen, as OPA will take only one book per ISBN, and\ndiscard all the other books with the same ISBN even if the other metadata is\ndifferent (I designed the service in this way to keep the code easy enough to\nunderstand), but if there are other operations like DeleteBook and IssueBook,\nthen the race conditions can cause issues.\n\nIn the `AddBook()` function, the user provided book details will be sent to the\nOPA server using a REST call. OPA will store this information in its in-memory\nstore at a unique place determined by the ISBN of the book. In actual cases, the\ndata should be stored in some persistent storage, such as a DB. OPA will take\nthe information from the DB. Again, to keep the implementation easy enough to\nunderstand, we are not using any such persistent storage. If any other book with\ndifferent metadata but the same ISBN comes, then OPA will overwrite the existing\nbook with the new one.\n\nIn the `SearchBook()` function, the user will provide the ISBN of the desired\nbook. The gRPC service will call the OPA using REST API and find if any such\nbook exists or not.\n\nThe `ListAllBooks()` is different in the way that it does not need any ISBN.\n\nNow, here one problem arises, how to make sure that the search results will not\nreturn any book which the user is not authorized to access. We will solve this\nproblem using OPA in the next and last post of this series.\n\nI hope that this post was helpful. If you have any doubts or want to say\nanything else, please comment. It will be a great motivation and appreciation\nfor me.\n\nThanks for reading. Cheers :smile:\n",

      "content_html": "\n**TL;DR** -- In a series of blog posts, I will be implementing a simple library\napplication supporting both gRPC and REST interfaces using Go, gRPC, and OPA. My\napproach might not be the most optimal one, but I am learning these technologies\ncurrently. Please give your valuable suggestions and be kind :)\n\nI have been learning the basics of microservices and Golang lately. On the work\nfront, I got a chance to work on Go, gRPC, and Open Policy Agent as my first\nprofessional project. In this post, I will be demonstrating what I learned in\nthe last few months. We will be implementing a simple gRPC based library\nservice, which will be able to serve requests using both gRPC and REST calls. It\nwill also incorporate the Open Policy Agent (OPA) to provide the authorization\nto users. Let's begin with a quick introduction to gRPC and OPA.\n\n## gRPC\n\ngRPC is Google's implementation for Remote Procedure Calls(RPC). RPC is mainly\nused in building scalable distributed systems. While REST has a limited set of\nverbs, RPC can define any function calls, including synchronous and asynchronous\ncalls.\n\nIn gRPC, the client can make procedure calls as if the requests are made to some\nlocal function. However, the underlying client stub (auto-generated) will send\nthe call to the server. The server will have a similar server stub, which will\nbe able to handle the requests coming from the client. The server will send the\nresponse to the client using similar mechanisms over the network. All the\ncommunication is serialized to binary format, so it is ideal for distributed\nsystems as binary format tends to be on the faster side for large amounts of\ndata.\n\nFor more info about gRPC, visit the official [website](https://grpc.io/).\n\n## Open Policy Agent (OPA)\n\nOPA gives us the ability to define a fine-grained policy control mechanism.\nHowever, I think the most critical benefit of using OPA is that it gives you the\nability to decouple your services and the definition of policies from the\nenforcement of it.\n\nThere are mainly two parts of OPA -\n\n1. A JSON document store where you can define anything from your users, access\n   roles, permission levels, etc.\n2. A policy is written in a declarative language. This policy gives you new\n   derivative data from the original JSON document store evaluated by the\n   policy. The declarative language is called Rego, and these policies are also\n   documents that generate results according to the defined policy. The users\n   query these results.\n\nThis info will be sufficient for our use case. More info about it can be found\nat the official [website](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/).\n\n## The skeleton of our Application\n\nWe will be building a command-line library application. This application will\nsupport adding, deleting, searching, issuing, and returning of books. There are\nthree types of users -- student, faculties, and staff. Not all users have a\nsimilar kind of access level. There are some books which are only reserved for\nstudents, and some are exclusively reserved for faculties and so on.\n\nI think emulating the\n[library](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Library) at Hogwarts will\nbe a good idea here. Students and ordinary people were not allowed inside the\nrestricted section of the library. We will emulate that restricted section using\nthe authorization mechanisms provided by OPA.\n\nThe gRPC protocol will handle the communications part in our app, but not\neveryone in Hogwarts is using gRPC. Wizards are still in love with REST (not a\nbad thing, though), so we will provide them alike the REST interface to interact\nwith our service. We do not want to face the wrath of the wizards, after all.\n\nOPA can either be used as a standalone application or be embedded in the Go\nservice as well. Both approaches have their pros and cons. I have decided to use\nOPA as an independent service, as it will be more comfortable that way for us to\npush authorization data and policies to it if such a need arises in the future.\n\nOne more issue remains - where to store the added books. Shall we persist them?\nIn practical scenarios, persistence is always a good idea, but here I do not\nwant to complicate things too much. We could use any Object storage servers\n(e.g., Minio) to store the JSON data generated from our gRPC methods, but that\nwill unnecessarily add complexity to our simple scenario. Wizards do not like\ncomplicate stuff, you know!\n\nIn the next posts, we will define our gRPC proto file and build the Go service\naround it. Then we will add a REST interface to our service for simple CRUD\noperations in our application. Then we will add OPA authorization to restrict\nour users from adding and viewing books which they are not supposed to access.\n\nThank you for reading. Cheers 😊\n",

      "content_html": "\nThe year 2018 has been quite a roller coaster year for me. I saw many ups and\ndowns, many successes, and many failures faced many challenges on the personal\nfront and struggled to keep myself on track. I have been working hard on\nimproving my lifestyle (not materialistically) for the last few years, and the\nbenefits have begun to show up now. This year was a pinnacle in that aspect. A\nlot of micro changes happened in my life this year.\n\nI often read my blog posts from last year. Reading these posts give me a good\nfeeling about the improvements that I could bring in myself during the previous\nthree years. Writing year [reviews](/blog/2017-the-best-till-now/) and posts\nlike [this](/blog/beginning-a-new-journey/),\n[this](/blog/mistakes-that-i-made-in-nitc/) and\n[this](/blog/deactivated-my-fb-account/) serve as documents of my deeds from\npast for my future. It helps me in not repeating the same mistakes. As a human\nbeing, I cannot run away from committing mistakes, but I can always make sure\nthat I do not repeat the same mistakes.\n\n> Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\n\n## Blogging & Writing\n\nI had set a target to write 15 blog articles at the beginning of this year. In\nthe end, I managed to achieve this goal. I managed to write 17 blog posts and\nsix book reviews. My blog managed to get much traffic this year, mainly thanks\nto some of my technical posts.\n\nI got some good responses from people about my technical blog posts. My aim to\nstart writing technical posts was to keep an account of what I learn. It feels\nvery nice when I go back to my posts to read how I did something last time. So I\nconsider myself successful that at least I could benefit from my writing.\n\nThough, in 2018, after leaving college, the frequency of technical posts on this\nblog has dipped to almost zero. It is probably because I am not exploring enough\nafter joining the corporate world. In college, I used Linux all the time, but\nnow it is nearly four months since I last booted Linux in my system. I think it\nis yet another phase of my learning, and I will take some time adjusting with\nthis. I have some _lovely_ technical post ideas, and I hope that I will be able\nto articulate them soon next year.\n\n## Reading\n\nFor most of the year, I did not pay any heed to books, and I was never very\ninterested in buying books. However, at the end of October, I purchased a Kindle\nPaperwhite. I consider this to be the\n[best](https://twitter.com/yash__here/status/1075396841267752963) investment\ndone by me this year. Since buying it, I have read eight books. I finally\nmanaged to finish my\n[Goodreads reading challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/10979019)\nof 10 books. Although I could not finish one book and included one\n[audiobook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31284204-the-millionaire-booklet)\nto this challenge to complete my target on time.\n\nThis year, I discovered my interest in Economics. I am reading some\neconomics-related literature lately. It is a subtle shift from my all-CS life. I\nplan to read a lot of economics-related books in 2019 to gain more expertise in\nthis domain. But I still need to figure out a way to stop it from interfering\nwith my first (or second, maybe!) love.\n\nSome of my favorite reads from this year (not in any particular order) -\n\n- **Technology / CS**\n\n  1.

[10 Types of Odd Friendships You’re Probably Part Of](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/10-types-odd-friendships-youre-probably-part.html)\n\nI used [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) extensively throughout the year\nto manage and save the articles that I liked. Although I was never very\nconsistent in reading those saved articles, it was still a good exercise. I\nfinished all my pending pile of saved articles by the end of the year. Moreover,\nfor this post, it became straightforward for me to recollect those links. This\nlist grew excessively large, but I did not want to lose any of these links\nbecause of some random third-party service shutting down, so I am adding them\nhere for easy reference in the future.\n\nNext year onwards, I plan to read one academic paper from my favorite areas of\nCS in every two weeks and summarise them to improve my understanding of the\ndomain (the [readings](/readings) section of my blog was initially intended for\nthis purpose). Moreover, seeing my experience in the last two months, I feel\nencouraged to increase my Goodreads reading challenge to 20 books.\n\n## Work\n\nThe year 2018 was a pivotal year for me on this front. It was the year when I\nhad to come out of the comfort zone of my parents' protection. My professional\nlife began this year, and I started earning MONEY. It feels delightful when you\nsee the money gets deposited to your bank account every month for the hard(!)\nwork that you have done for the last one month. But\n\n> With great power comes great responsibility.\n\nI believe that I have been able to control this feeling of power quite nicely\nuntil now. Probably being an _Agarwal_ helped :P\n\nComing back to work, those who do not know, I joined Cisco Systems this year as\na Software Engineer. The job is pretty good for my initial expectations. I made\nsome good friends. First time in my life, I managed to make a group of friends.\n\nQuite an achievement.\n\n## Studies\n\nThis year was officially my last year in formal education.\n{/* May I convert all the opportunities that God is going to give me soon in this regard */}\nAlthough I failed to finish my bachelors with a satisfactory final GPA (at least\nI am not happy with it), I am very much satisfied with all my learnings from\ncollege. I learned many life lessons, kept myself in check, built some useful\ncontacts, learned a lot about many CS-related things, and ended up with a decent\njob in the end.\n\nHowever, I sense that this is not the happy ending of my journey towards\nlearning, and I have a lot more to learn. I recently read the book \"The\nAlchemist,\" and the central theme of this book is to keep looking for your\nlegend. I am still searching for my legend. In 2019, I expect to find new ways\nto keep learning and explore new areas both in CS and other fields of life.\n\n## Relationships\n\nBefore this year, I had an assumption that I lack social skills. I hesitated in\ntalking to people. I decided to change it this year. I was waiting for a change\nin my life, probably because NITC had become too monotonous for me. It was one\nof my new year's resolution that I will change myself and become more\napproachable to people.\n\nI do not know if I have changed or not, but I feel much more confident now than\never in communicating with people. I hope I will continue to improve in 2019 as\nwell.\n\n## Social Media\n\nI was trying to get rid of Facebook for quite some time. This year, I finally\nmanaged to control my addiction. For a good part of the year, either my Facebook\naccount remained deactivated, or I was logged out of it. In the past, I used to\nfeel a strong urge to open Facebook every ten minutes, but this year, I was able\nto keep this urge in control. When my account was not deactivated, I kept myself\nso busy in other works, that I did not even think of Facebook.\n\nMoreover, the good thing is that I did not notice any symptoms of withdrawal\nsymptoms because of this sudden quitting of Facebook. A friend's advice worked\nnicely. It was quite tricky, indeed.\n\nI was never addicted to any other social media platform, but I decided that I\ncan use Twitter for my benefit. I feel Twitter is a useful tool if utilized\ncorrectly. I followed many people who tweet regularly about CS related stuff. I\nopen Twitter once every 2-3 days for a very short duration to collect some\narticles and tips. Nowadays, these articles, along with a few blog articles from\nFeedly, mainly form my Instapaper feed. Though Instapaper recently switched to\ncommercial model again, I decided to keep using it for the time being until I\nfind some other alternative.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nI had decided to exercise for at least 90% part of 2018. I failed miserably.\nLeave alone every day; I could not even do it continuously for one month. I need\nto make this a top priority. Otherwise, it is going to create trouble for me\nsoon.\n\nFor the last two years, I am trying to get up early in the morning every day. My\nbody does not seem to care, though. It seems a classic example of the struggle\nbetween mind and body. My brain says that I am an early bird, but my body\nstraightforwardly rejects this idea. I have felt the positives of waking up\nearly, so I am still trying my best so that my body can adjust to this change. I\nwill keep working on this habit in 2019 as well.\n\nI noticed a bad habit in myself - procrastination. I procrastinated a lot\nin 2018. Things that I could have finished well within the deadlines took me\nages to complete. I was always late in my BTech project deadlines, I could not\nfinish one of my hobby projects, I could not finish my study targets on time,\nand many other such examples haunted me this year. It is one of my most\nimportant goals of 2019 that I need a way to find how to concentrate on one\nthing at a time. Many things distract me while I am working. Technology itself\nis a significant distraction, but because I am a CS professional, this is one\nthing from which I cannot run away. However, I will still try to avoid getting\ndistracted by my _curiosity_ and put more focus on doing work.\n\nI am writing more than ever. However, with my increased writing, my English\nvocabulary is not enough anymore. This year, it happened many times that I\nwanted to write something, but because of the lack of proper words in my\nvocabulary, I had to settle with _inferior_ words. I tried multiple times this\nyear to work on improving my vocabulary, but I failed badly. I will increase my\nfocus on improving my knowledge of English in 2019 so that such small issues do\nnot stop me from adding something to my skills.\n\nThis year, I experimented and tried to organize myself with to-do lists. It was\na fruitful exercise, and it had a lot of sound effects on my productivity. The\ndays when I made a to-do list, I felt very energetic and encouraged to finish\nall the tasks on my list. However, then I noticed one thing, I could not\ncontinue doing this for more than a few days at once. For initial days, I felt\nencouraged to complete my tasks, but soon it began to appear as a burden, and I\nfelt exhausted. So it seems that something in the middle will work for me. This\nyear, I will continue using to-do lists (I use Google Keep for this) but for\nshort durations of time. I will refrain from using it every day to avoid getting\nexhausted. I am considering a switch to [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to\nmaintain my monthly and long-term goals. Probably that will also help me in\nkeeping track of my goals without feeling the heat.\n\nAll of my friends love to travel. It seems a common habit in most of my friends.\nHowever, I am an exception. I'm not particularly eager to go on trips. I\nattribute it to my issues with motion sickness. For the whole year of 2018, I do\nnot have a single trip memory other than my travels to Bengaluru and Jaipur\nairports. Oh yeah, after thinking for some time, I recalled that I went on one\ntrip from Bengaluru to Calicut to attend my convocation ceremony. That's all! I\nwill _consider_ accepting trip invitations from my friends in 2019. Up until\nnow, I keep refusing to join them in their trips due to my health issues, my\ndesire to stay in solitude and partially because of my unwillingness to explore\nanything outside technology. However, it is time I start changing myself.\n\nIt was a grave mistake that during my four-year stay in Kerala, I did not try to\nlearn Malayalam. I feel that I missed an excellent opportunity to learn a new\nlanguage. Although I am as bad as other north Indians when it comes to knowing\nmultiple languages (correct me if I am wrong, I do not intend to generalize all\nnorth Indians), I think that learning a new language can be very beneficial for\n_some parts of my brain_. Now I am in Karnataka, yet another south Indian state\nand with yet another language. It is an excellent opportunity, and I am not\ngoing to repeat my mistake this time. Even if I do not succeed in learning\nKannada, it will provide enough challenges to my brain for the short term. Who\nknows, it might also give me a new skill!\n\n**Welcome 2019, I hope that you will help me in taking a step closer to\ndiscovering myself. Give me new experiences, keep me grounded and help me in\ncontributing to the progress of my India.** :blush:\n",

      "content_html": "\nWhen I was in eighth (or was it ninth?) class, one of our teachers asked in the\nclass, what do you want to become in your life? People said a lot of things.\nWhen my turn came up, I stood up and said, _“Mein software engineer banana\nchahta hu”_ (I want to become a software engineer). It was not that I was\ngenuinely interested in Computers. When I look back now, I realize that it was\nmy cousins who affected my choice (in an indirect way), and their achievements\nfascinated me to aim at this particular career choice.\n\nMy whole life for the last seven years was revolving around this one dream(!) of\ngetting a job in an MNC. I got my chance when I got placed in Cisco last\nMonsoon. I was super excited about joining Cisco since then. Perhaps because of\nthe MacBook on which I am typing this article right now :smile: and partly\nbecause of the monotonicity of the NIT-C environment. I wanted to break out of\nthe comfort zone that I had built there around myself in NIT-C. Changing place\nseemed the only viable option.\n\nI have been doing a self-introspection for the last four to five months. My blog\nposts from the previous few months reflect some hints about my introspections. I\nhave mentioned my observations here and there in a few of my blog posts. I\ndiscovered some unique aspects of my personality. On the other hand, I found out\nsome traits which are pretty weird (in my opinion :) ). I am not going to\npublish all of my findings, but one thing became apparent, my social anxiety\nrequires my immediate attention.\n\nIt is quite difficult to change some aspects of our personality; usually those\nwe are born with. But most of the qualities that define someone keeps changing.\nLife experiences play an essential role in determining a person’s character.\nSuccess and failure define a person. I firmly believe that no person ever\nremains the same. People continuously go through phases of realizations and the\nups and downs in the career, academics, broken trusts, dampening creativity,\ngrowing age, success, glory, hatred, and betrayals. People become what they are\nbecause of the world around them. These realizations come from experiences and\nexperiences that come from bad experiences.\n\nI learned this the hard way!\n\nSo, I decided, I will not commit those similar set of mistakes again. I will\nmake new mistakes :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. I realized that there exists a\nworld outside computers and tech. I need to go and talk to people. If not random\nstrangers, I should talk to my friends, take part in various activities, play\nsome sport, focus on my fitness and mental health, and go on trips. And of\ncourse, perform well in work and maintain a good work-life balance if it is not\na\n[myth](https://medium.com/the-ascent/is-work-life-balance-a-myth-c328377966de).\n\nI cannot change the past now. It is only the future that is yet in my power. I\nam eager to see how my current actions are going to affect my future.\n\nAt last, let me finish this article by quoting Winston Churchill (Although I am\nnot a big fan of him, this quote is worth sharing).\n\n> If we open a quarrel between past and present, we shall find that we have lost\n> the future.\n\nCheers. 😊\n",

      "content_html": "\nFour years ago, in this very month of June, JEE Mains results were out. I had\nscrewed up my JEE Advanced, so I had to settle for an NIT. My AIR was good\nenough to get me a seat of Computer Science and Engineering in any of the NITs\nexcept the first three (at that time Trichy, Warangal, and Surathkal). I was\nskeptical about going to [NIT Calicut](http://nitc.ac.in/) because of its\ndistance from my native place, so NIT Allahabad was the most suitable choice.\nHowever, in the end, I decided to give preference to NIT Calicut over NIT\nAllahabad. One of the many reasons for this decision was an excellent\n[article](https://dsanghi.blogspot.com/2011/05/my-2011-list-of-recommended-csit.html)\nby Dr. Dheeraj Sanghi, a retired professor from IIT Kanpur. His blog post was\nthe primary reason; I decided to go with NIT Calicut. Now that I have graduated\nfrom NIT Calicut, I think it is the right time to document my observations about\nthe CSE department of NIT Calicut from the perspective of a student.\n\nMy exposure to the CSE department was limited to the facilities provided to\nundergraduate students only (almost everything except some academic facilities),\nso I am not entirely sure if this article will help any of the postgraduate\nstudents out there. However, some points below might help you decide about the\nnon-academic activities of the department.\n\n## Faculties\n\nLike every other NIT, NIT Calicut also suffers from the lack of permanent\nfaculties. Most of the faculties in the department are recruited on a contract\nbasis (ad-hoc). It is **not** necessarily a\n[bad](https://dsanghi.blogspot.com/2018/05/teaching-by-temps-it-is-budget-issue-too.html)\nthing, but many a time, an ad-hoc faculty gets to teach a subject where one does\nnot hold strong command. In that case, the subject becomes a burden for both\nstudent and teacher. It happened to me many times when I was stuck in a\nsituation that I ended up losing my interest in the subject as well as grades.\n\nMost of the core subjects are taught by permanent faculties who are very good at\ntheir subjects. These faculties are very experienced and are alumni of some of\nIndia's top IITs and IISc. The department used to\n[ask](https://dsanghi.blogspot.com/2011/05/my-2011-list-of-recommended-csit.html)\nnew hires to get a postgraduate degree from some IIT or IISc, but this does not\nseem to be the case anymore.\n\nMost of the professors prefer to teach traditional computer science subjects, so\nif you are interested in AI, Data Science, or any other such areas of computer\nscience, then you might have to depend on self-study.\n\n## Club Activities\n\n[CSEA](http://assoc.cse.nitc.ac.in/) is the main departmental club that\norganizes almost every co-curricular activity in the department. In my opinion,\nCSEA is the best department association in NIT Calicut. I was not a member of\nCSEA, so all of my views are from the perspective of an outsider. CSEA organizes\ntalks and workshops for the freshers from time to time. I attended all the\nlectures and seminars arranged by CSEA in my initial years, and I feel that\nthose workshops were quite beneficial for me as a student.\n\nFOSSCell is a group of students who contribute to open-source software. FOSSCell\norganizes workshops related to Linux and open source contributions. It also\norganizes [FOSSMeet](http://fossmeet.in/), the yearly free and open-source\nsoftware conference organized in NIT-C. It is one of the largest gatherings of\nopen source enthusiasts in South India. I have written two posts about my\nexperience as a part of the organizing team of FOSSMeet. You can read them\n[here](/blog/fossmeet-17/) and [here](/blog/fossmeet-18/). Attending and\norganizing FOSSMeet is one of the best experiences of my college life. The\ncurrent executives of FOSSCell are actively working on improving the state of\nopen source contributions in NIT-C. I hope the situation will change in the\ncoming years.\n\nThe students manage all the labs in the department. The\n[Software Systems Lab](http://athena.nitc.ac.in/) is assigned to undergraduate\nstudents. This lab is probably the crown jewel and pride of every CS student of\nNIT Calicut. It remains open most of the time. All the department servers are\nkept in this lab and are managed independently by the student administrators\nchosen by the student administrators. The student administrators are given the\nresponsibility to maintain all the department websites. I do not know if any\nother university or college in India provides such independence to its students.\nI was one of the student administrators in this lab, and I consider that this\nwas the best thing that happened to me during my graduation.\n\n## The Infrastructure\n\nA traditional computer science course does not require many types of equipment\nexcept a laptop and a fast enough internet connection. Internet speed is not\nextraordinary in NIT-C, but it was sufficient for me. The network administrators\nblocked many websites, but if the site is related to coursework, sending a short\nmail was enough in most cases to get it unblocked.\n\nThe labs are equipped with modern computer systems, and Ubuntu is installed on\nalmost every department system. The particular emphasis on the use of\nopen-source software is a big plus point for the department.\n\n## Courses\n\nThe curriculum was last updated in 2010. Since then, six batches have graduated.\nI think it is an excellent time to consider revising it. The current curriculum\nis good enough for most traditional CS subjects, but its focus on the present\nbuzzwords of the CS world is very less. I heard that the department changed the\ncurriculum for the batches joining 2017 onwards, but I doubt that there are any\nsignificant changes.\n\n{/* However, the department currently lacks enough number of faculties to teach those subjects, so */}\n\nThe academics are taken quite seriously in the department (apparently). The\nlevel of question papers in examinations is generally very tough. I always felt\nthe heat, at least. However, teachers are quite friendly and will help you with\nany of your queries.\n\nThe situation of lab courses (except OS, Compilers, and DSA lab) in the\ndepartment is very pathetic. Operating Systems lab and Compiler lab have a\nwell-defined structure, and the feeling of developing your tiny OS or compiler\nis one of the best feelings ever. Data Structure and Algorithms lab runs in\nparallel to the corresponding theory course, and that helps students in\nunderstanding theory by practice.\n\nI cannot say the same about any other lab in the department; most of the\nstudents end up learning nothing new from these lab courses. The problem is in\nthe way these courses are handled. There does not seem to be a proper structure\nof teaching in these courses. Students are expected to learn on their own and\ncome to the lab and give exams. Although most of the time, the corresponding\ntheory course carries marks for a mini project which compensates for the lab\ncourse, these lab courses do have some scope for improvements.\n\n## Placements & Higher Studies\n\nThe department does not handle placements, but the quality of education and the\nfocus on industry-oriented courses do affect the placements. The placement\ndepartment of NIT-C has been doing an excellent job of maintaining a track\nrecord of over 90% placements from computer science every year.\n\nDepartment, as such, does not focus on placements much. I feel that the\ndepartment is more interested in making researchers than software engineers.\nMost of the courses are very heavily inclined towards theory. From my batch, I\nknow at least ten people who are planning to go to the USA for higher studies in\nthe next two years. The faculties also encourage students to pursue higher\neducation (and subsequently research). Perhaps, it is one of the reasons that\nthe state of competitive coding is not very good in the department.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite continuous lack of good permanent faculties and its location\ndisadvantages, CSED of NIT-C has managed to produce competent engineers year by\nyear. Spending four years in Kerala can be a different experience for outsiders,\nespecially North Indians, but it is an experience worth gaining. If you have a\ngood rank in JEE Mains and do not mind going too far from home, CSED of NIT\nCalicut is an excellent choice. I hope you will not regret the decision, though\nI will not say the same about other departments of NIT-C.\n\nIf you decide to join NIT-C, do read my article about my\n[experience](/blog/mistakes-that-i-made-in-nitc/) at NIT Calicut.\n\nThanks to my friends [Aashish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aashishsatya),\n[Mahaveer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahaveer-chouhan-575abba7/) and\n[Faris](https://www.facebook.com/faris.shajahan.1) for reading the drafts of\nthis article and providing their suggestions.\n\nBest wishes.

      "content_html": "\nI am using _i3_ window manager for the last seven months, and it has been a\npleasant and productive experience so far. There were a few hiccups here and\nthere, but that is expected with such minimalistic setups. One thing that I\nnever noticed was the lack of notifications on critical battery levels. For the\nlast few months, my laptop battery was discharging to 0% all the time. Probably\nthis proved to be too fatal for my battery. According to this\n[article](https://lifehacker.com/how-often-should-i-charge-my-gadgets-battery-to-prolong-5875162),\nlithium-ion batteries are not expected to go from 100% to 0% frequently. I\nrecently bought a new battery, and I did not want to reduce the lifespan of this\nbattery too. So I decided to set up battery notifications for my i3 setup.\n\nI [found](https://agorf.gr/2016/06/29/low-battery-notification-in-i3wm/) a bash\nscript which shows a notification using _notify-send_ when battery charge level\nreaches or drops below a configured threshold. However, I had to do some\nadditional steps to make this script work on my system.\n\nThe first issue was the _lockfile_ program, which was not installed in my\nsystem. I installed it using the following command.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install procmail\n```\n\nThe second issue was more difficult to solve. I planned to set up the script to\nrun every minute using _cron_. However, it turns out that cron operates in a\nvery\n[minimalistic](https://askubuntu.com/questions/23009/why-crontab-scripts-are-not-working/23438#23438)\nenvironment and notify-send requires the presence of some special variables in\nthe environment. These variables are **DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS**,\n**XAUTHORITY** and **DISPLAY**. To provide the values of these variables to the\ncron environment, I modified the script and sourced a new file `.bat_envs`.\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n. /home/yash/.bat_envs\n\nTHRESHOLD=15\n\nlock_path='/tmp/battery.lock'\n\nlockfile -r 0 $lock_path 2>/dev/null || exit\n\nacpi_path=$(find /sys/class/power_supply/ -name 'BAT*' | head -1)\ncharge_now=$(cat \"$acpi_path/charge_now\")\ncharge_full=$(cat \"$acpi_path/charge_full\")\ncharge_status=$(cat \"$acpi_path/status\")\ncharge_percent=$(printf '%.0f' $(echo \"$charge_now / $charge_full * 100\"\n | bc -l))\nmessage=\"Battery running critically low at $charge_percent%!\"\n\nif [[ $charge_status == 'Discharging' ]] && [[ $charge_percent -le $THRE\nSHOLD ]]; then\n  /usr/bin/notify-send -u critical \"Low battery\" \"$message\"\n\n  current_date_time=\"`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`\";\n  echo \"[BATTERY LOG] = $charge_percent% on $current_date_time\"\nfi\n\nrm -f $lock_path\n```\n\nRead this blog\n[post](https://agorf.gr/2016/06/29/low-battery-notification-in-i3wm/) to\nunderstand how this script works.\n\nAs the notify-send requires some special X session environmental variables, we\nwill need a method to provide these variables to notify-send in cron\nenvironment. The safest way to get X session related environmental variables is\nto get them from the environment of a process of the user who is logged on to X.\nThe following script will run every time a user logs in and stores these\nvariables in a file `.bat_envs`.\n\n{/* https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/111194 */}\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nenv_path=\"$HOME/.bat_envs\"\n\nrm -f \"${env_path}\"\ntouch \"${env_path}\"\n\ncopy_envs=\"XAUTHORITY DISPLAY DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\"\n\nfor env_name in $copy_envs\ndo\n    env | grep \"${env_name}\" >> \"${env_path}\";\n    echo \"export ${env_name}\" >> \"${env_path}\";\ndone\n\nchmod 600 \"${env_path}\"\n```\n\nTo run this script at startup, I added this file to the i3 config file with the\nfollowing command.\n\n```bash\nexec --no-startup-id \"path to your script\"\n```\n\nThen at the end of cron file, I added a new entry for the battery monitoring\nscript.\n\nTo open cron file:\n\n```bash\ncrontab -e\n```\n\nNow add the following line to the end of the file and save the file.\n\n```bash\n* * * * * bash \"path to your script\" >> \"path to your log file\"\n```\n\nReplace the _path to your script_ (with double quotes) with your script path and\nthe _path to your log file_ with a path where you want to save your log file.\n\nNow every minute, this script will be executed, and if your battery percent\ndrops below the threshold value, you will be notified with a notification\nbubble.\n\nI tested this procedure on _Ubuntu 18.04 with i3_. It should work on Arch Linux\nand other non-Debian distributions also, but the steps might be slightly\ndifferent due to various reasons. Please comment if you face any issues with the\nsetup.\n\nThank you for reading the article. Cheers 😄\n",

      "content_html": "\nNow that I am graduated from NIT Calicut, one more chapter of my life is over.\nIt is time to move on to the next page, but before I begin that phase, I thought\nit would be nice, to sum up, the experience that I gathered in NIT Calicut. The\nlast four years have been great for me. I learned a lot of new life lessons, but\nthere were some decisions that I could have avoided. I take full responsibility\nfor my actions and do not blame anybody for the same. Although I do not regret\ntaking any of those decisions, I feel it is crucial to document all those\nlessons before they vanish from my _otherwise_ average memory. This post is\nintended to serve as a document for my future self, but most of the content here\nshould be able to help anyone who happens to read this post. Most of this\ncontent has been taken from my journal, which I maintained (not consistently)\nover the last two years.\n\n## Studies\n\nFrom the first year itself, I had an impression from various online QA sites and\nsome seniors that studies are not a big deal in college. That was a grave\nmistake which cost me a lot during my college life. I tried to compensate for it\nin the latter half of my graduation, but that was not enough.\n\nWhile my friends used to learn by teaching each other, I never enjoyed studying\nin groups. I wish I had participated more in such group learning activities.\n\nMost of the courses taught in traditional colleges like NITC are useless, in my\nopinion. However, Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) was one subject which\nshows its importance again and again. It is one of those subjects where I should\nhave put more attention. Although I was suffering from a fracture at the time of\nthis course, some more efforts from my side could have changed things as they\nare today.\n\n## Wrong learning methods\n\nI always tended to learn anything new using the tutorials available on the\nInternet. It is fine, but I never tried to do any projects/practicals to\nstrengthen my learning. In my experience, it is always better to learn any\nprogramming language by doing projects in it.\n\nMy first programming language was C, which was taught in an introductory course\nin the first year. C is a relatively low-level language, and it helped me in\nunderstanding many concepts and working on many systems related stuff. Still, I\nfeel that it is also one of the reasons that I am not able to think in\nhigher-level abstraction. When I started learning Python, I was not able to\nthink anything in abstract terms. I wish I had put more effort into learning\nPython or any other OOP language early in my college life.\n\n## Communication\n\nI have always been an introvert person when it comes to communicating with\npeople. I wish I had worked on improving this aspect of my personality. For the\nfirst two years, I never asked any seniors for advice, never asked any questions\nin the classroom, never discussed project ideas with any faculty. I tried to\nimprove myself in the last two years, and I feel satisfied with my efforts. In\nmy opinion, it is always better to ask a more experienced person for their\nadvice than to take blind steps and regret later.\n\nI was hesitant about talking to people from different linguistic backgrounds in\nmy first and second years. Again thanks to my inability to communicate with new\npeople. I improved this later, but first impressions are crucial, if not\neverything.\n\n## Friends and seniors\n\nIn my first year, I made a mistake by choosing to befriend some people who\nidentified themselves as _state seniors_ (people from the same north Indian\nstate as I am). I was naive in identifying people at that time, but when I look\nback now, I feel that if I had avoided those people and invested that time in\nlearning something related to CS, I could have gained more out of college. For a\nperson who was entirely new for CS, that one year's time was very crucial, and I\ncompletely wasted it. It took me two years to rectify my mistake.\n\n## Not taking breaks\n\nI never took breaks from learning new things. I always put my work ahead of my\npersonal life. That was the wrong approach. However, I do not blame myself for\nthis. I was new to such work-life equations, and I did not realize the\nrequirement to maintain a proper work-life balance. I wanted to learn a lot of\nnew things, and college provided me a suitable environment, but I feel that I\nexhausted myself many times. That resulted in my loss of interest from Computer\nScience also in the second year.\n\n## Writing and Reading\n\nI was never a voracious reader in my childhood. I never tried to spend my free\ntime with books. After coming to college, I saw many people reading books day\nand night. That inspired me to develop a new hobby of **Reading**. Although I\nstill do not read a lot (just 5-6 books a year), it is better than reading none.\n\nI started this blog in the second year. My intention was _not_ to write. I just\nwanted to learn how to set up Wordpress and Jekyll. However, slowly I developed\nthe habit of writing. I now consider it the biggest takeaway from college.\nWriting a blog has helped me learn new things and systematically explain things.\n\nI tried to write a journal to document significant events in life, but I could\nnot maintain it regularly. That is one thing which I would like to improve in\nthe coming years.\n",

      "id": "https://v2.yashagarwal.in/blog/proxy-your-requests-to-the-backend-server-with-grunt",
      "content_html": "\n_This article was originally published on\n[zeolearn](https://www.zeolearn.com/magazine/proxy-your-requests-to-the-backend-server-with-grunt)._\n\nIf you are working on large projects, it is undoubtedly a good idea to have a\nbuild script or some task scripts to help to automate some of the repetitive\nparts of the development process. For JavaScript projects, `Grunt` serves a\nsimilar purpose. It is a JavaScript task/build runner that is written on top of\nNodeJS. Grunt can help you with automatically minifying your JavaScript or CSS\nfiles, or reload your browser on every file change. It can show you a\ncomprehensive list of JavaScript errors, compile your `SASS/LESS` files into CSS\nfiles automatically, and many other things.\n\nHowever, the most significant advantage of Grunt that I am going to discuss\ntoday is its ability to proxy your requests. For example, when you are\ndeveloping your backend with anything other than JavaScript, you will face\ndifficulty in accessing the backend data in your frontend without having to\ncompile and deploy the code every time you make any changes. It is not possible\nwith a typical web server setup because\n[XHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest) requests are not allowed to\nbe cross-domain by browsers due to\n[Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)\n(CORS) limitations.\n\nSo, the problem here is as follows,\n\n> you are developing the UI of your applications using some frontend JavaScript\n> framework (say Angular) with Grunt as the build runner, and the backend of\n> your application is being designed in some backend framework other than\n> JavaScript/NodeJS (say Laravel), you might face problems accessing the backend\n> while running Grunt server.\n\nIt happens because the backend Laravel service runs on port 8000, and the front\nend development server runs on port 8080. The requests from the frontend server\nto the backend-server will result in\n[same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)\nerrors due to the port difference. To fix this issue, we can set up CORS through\na proxy on Grunt. This proxy will stand in front of your frontend server and the\nbackend server and get the required data from the backend and pass it to your\nfrontend while letting your browser think that you are all in the same domain.\n\nGrunt has a module\n[grunt-connect-proxy](https://github.com/drewzboto/grunt-connect-proxy) that\nexists to help to solve this issue. It delegates requests that match a given URL\nto the backend of your choice. So for example, you want to access your backend\nusing the URL [http://localhost:8080/api](http://localhost:8080/api), you can\nwrite a proxy rule so that whenever your user tries to access this URL in a\nbrowser, the proxy will get the data from your backend and server it at this\nparticular URL.\n\nThe procedure to set up the proxy is simple. First, you will have to add the\nproxy configuration to your `Gruntfile.js`. In this example, I am assuming that\nthe backend server is running on the port 8000, and the Grunt server is running\non the port 8080. This configuration will delegate all requests to\n[http://localhost:8080/api](http://localhost:8080/api) to\n[http://localhost:8000/backend](http://localhost:8000/backend).\n\n```js\nconnect: {\n  server: {\n    options: {\n      port: 8080,\n      base: 'public',\n      hostname: 'localhost',\n      livereload: true,\n      middleware: function (connect, options, middlewares) {\n        middlewares.unshift(require('grunt-connect-proxy/lib/utils').proxyRequest);\n        return middlewares;\n      }\n    },\n    proxies: [\n      {\n        context: '/api',\n        host: 'localhost',\n        port: 8000,\n        https: false,\n        rewrite: {\n            '^/api': '/backend'\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow register your Grunt server task to run the proxy on Grunt execution.\n\n```js\ngrunt.registerTask(\"server\", function (target) {\n  grunt.task.run([\"configureProxies:server\", \"connect:server\"])\n})\n```\n\nLet me explain the above two scripts line by line. In the connect section of\nyour `Gruntfile`, we add a new section called `proxies`. The options defined in\nthe proxies section are explained below.\n\n- **context**: This is the context against which the incoming requests will be\n  matched. Matching requests will be proxied to the backend server.\n- **host**: The host address where the backend server is running. The incoming\n  requests will be proxied to this host.\n- **port**: The port where the backend server is running.\n- **https**: If your backend server is an https endpoint, then set this value to\n  `true`.\n- **rewrite**: This option allows rewriting of URL when proxying. What this\n  means is that when trying to proxy\n  [http://localhost:8080/api](http://localhost:8080/api) to the backend server,\n  the URL will be rewritten as\n  [http://localhost:8000/backend](http://localhost:8000/backend). The object's\n  key serves as the regex used in the replacement operation, and the object's\n  value is the context of your backend server's service.\n\nMore options can be found in the\n[documentation](https://github.com/drewzboto/grunt-connect-proxy#grunt-connect-proxy)\nof `grunt-connect-proxy`.\n\nYou will also need to set up the proxy's middleware in the `options` section of\nthe `connect`. The relevant code is as follows.\n\n```js\n...\nmiddleware: function (connect, options, middlewares) {\n  middlewares.unshift(require('grunt-connect-proxy/lib/utils').proxyRequest);\n  return middlewares;\n}\n...\n```\n\nFinally, include your proxy task in the server task. It is necessary to append\nthe proxy task before the connect task. Also, make sure to specify the\nconnection target in the `configureProxies` section. In our case, the connect\ntarget is `server`.\n\nNow you can start your Grunt server via this configured proxy by typing\n`Grunt server` in the command line. You should see something like this in the\nconsole.\n\n```sh\n$ grunt server\n...\nRunning \"configureProxies:server\" (configureProxies) task\nRewrite rule created for: [/^\\/api/ -> /backend].\nProxy created for: /api to localhost:8000\n\nRunning \"connect:server\" (connect) task\nStarted connect web server on http://localhost:8080\n...\n```\n\nThe above output confirms that the proxy is working fine. Some of the example\nURLs are:\n\n{/* TODO table formatting */} | Grunt Server | Backend Server | |\n----------------------------- | --------------------------------- | |\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8080/api | http://127.0.0.1:8000/backend | |\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8080/api/x/y | http://127.0.0.1:8000/backend/x/y |\n\nThat's all. Now you will not face any problems getting data from any backend of\nyour choice.\n",

      "content_html": "\nThis post is a result of my experimentation with Drozer. Drozer is a security\ntesting framework for Android, developed by MWR Labs. According the Drozer's\nofficial\n[documentation](https://labs.f-secure.com/assets/BlogFiles/mwri-drozer-user-guide-2015-03-23.pdf):\n\n> Drozer allows you to assume the role of an Android app and interact with other\n> apps. It can do anything that an installed application can do, such as making\n> use of Android's Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism and interact with\n> the underlying operating system.\n\nDrozer modules are written in Python. The module performs operations on an\nAndroid device with the help of an agent app installed on the device. The agent\napp, by default, has permission to use the internet connection only. This\npermission is required so that the agent can open a ServerSocket on port 31415\n(default). The agent will listen for the incoming connections on this port. The\nconsole will connect to the agent on this port.\n\nDrozer modules are inherited Python classes. The parent class is defined in\n[drozer.modules.Module](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/drozer/blob/develop/src/drozer/modules/base.py).\nDrozer console provides commands to create a custom module repository, which is\nvery useful for the local development of modules.\n\nYou can read more about the structure of a Drozer module\n[here](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/drozer/wiki/Writing-a-Module).\n\nI will explain all the critical parts of a Drozer module with the help of a\nsample module. I will be implementing a module to record and save the sound from\nthe inbuilt mic of an Android device.\n\nI initialized a new module repository using the Drozer console using the\nfollowing command.\n\n```text\ndz> module repository create custom\nInitialised repository at custom.\n```\n\nYou will see a new directory `custom` in your current directory after executing\nabove command. Navigate to this directory and create a new folder with any name.\nI prefer to name this folder same as my module name. In this folder, create a\nfile `__init__.py`. Drozer identifies the folder as a module directory if\n`__init__.py` is present in the directory. Now you can implement your module in\nthis directory.\n\nTo begin implementing our module, create a new file `record.py` in the module\ndirectory. Drozer has many different utility classes, which we can use to\nsimplify our implementation. To use these utility classes\n([mixins](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/drozer/wiki/Using-mixins)), our module\nclass must extend _mixins_ using Python's multiple inheritance feature.\n\nWe first need to import all the required mixins. The mixins are stored in\n`modules.common` package in the Drozer source tree. After importing mixins and\nextending our class, the code will look like this. You can also import any other\nstandard Python module here.\n\n```python\nfrom drozer.modules import common, Module\nimport os, subprocess, time\n\nclass Record(Module, common.Shell, common.FileSystem, common.ClassLoader):\n```\n\nNow we will set up the metadata for our module. This information will help\nDrozer to organize and list our module correctly. We can define the name,\ndescription, author, date, license, path, permissions, and examples. Most of the\navailable options are self-explanatory. But _path_ and _permissions_ require\nsome explanation.\n\nThe _path_ variable defined here is an array that contains the values for the\nnamespace of the module. Drozer supports separate namespaces for each module. We\ncan combine similar modules in the same namespace using this feature.\n\nThe _permissions_ array variable contains all the permissions that this module\nwill require for proper functioning. For example, our module will need\npermission to record audio on the device to work correctly. So we define this\npermission in the permissions array. The agent app on the device is required to\nhave this permission. Otherwise, our module will throw an error.\n\nThe following snippet shows the metadata section of our module.\n\n```text\nname = \"Record sound from the inbuilt mic of an Android device.\"\ndescription = \"Record sound from the inbuilt mic of an Android device. The default save format is 3GPP. Relies on the agent having the RECORD_AUDIO permission.\"\nexamples = \"\"\"\ndz> run custom.record.record\nSetting up recorder configuration...\nRecording started\nPress any key to stop recording\n\nRecording stopped...downloading recording\nScreenshot captured. Saved at location /home/yash/work/drozer/1524201166.3gp\n\"\"\"\nauthor: \"Yash Agarwal\"\ndate: \"2018-04-14\"\nlicense = \"BSD (3 clause)\"\npath = [\"custom\", \"record\"]\npermissions = [\"android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\", \"com.mwr.dz.permissions.GET_CONTEXT\"]\n```\n\nNow we can start implementing the heart of our module, the `execute()` function.\nThis function will be invoked by Drozer when the module is run. Every action\nthat the module is expected to perform should be implemented in this method.\n\nThe implementation of `execute()` method is slightly tricky and requires an\nunderstanding of different classes and methods provided by the Android API. As\nwe are writing a module to record sound, we will look into the documentation of\n[MediaRecorder](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediarecorder.html)\nclass. Before reading further, go through the documentation about the use of\nreflection API in Drozer\n[here](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/drozer/wiki/Using-Reflection).\n\nThe `execute()` function is given below.\n\n```python\ndef execute(self, arguments):\n    # unique file names\n    filename = str(int(time.time())) + \".3gp\"\n\n    # current working directory of Drozer console\n    cwd = self.workingDir()\n\n    # Magic of Reflection API !!!\n    recorder = self.new(\"android.media.MediaRecorder\")\n    AudioSource = self.klass(\"android.media.MediaRecorder$AudioSource\")\n    OutputFormat = self.klass(\"android.media.MediaRecorder$OutputFormat\")\n    AudioEncoder = self.klass(\"android.media.MediaRecorder$AudioEncoder\")\n\n    recorder.setAudioSource(AudioSource.MIC)\n    recorder.setOutputFormat(OutputFormat.THREE_GPP)\n    recorder.setAudioEncoder(AudioEncoder.AMR_NB)\n    recorder.setOutputFile(\"%s/recording.3gp\" % cwd)\n    recorder.prepare()\n\n    self.stdout.write(\"Recording started\\n\")\n    recorder.start()\n    raw_input(\"Press any key to stop recording\\n\")\n    recorder.stop()\n    self.stdout.write(\"Recording stopped...\\n\")\n    recorder.reset()\n    recorder.release()\n\n    # Download file from device to PC\n    length = self.downloadFile(\"%s/recording.3gp\" % cwd, filename)\n\n    if length != None:\n        self.stdout.write(\"Recording saved\\n\")\n\n    else:\n        self.stderr.write(\"Recording could not be fetched from the device.\\n\")\n```\n\nI followed the sample use case given on\n[this](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder.html)\npage, to instantiate and use the _MediaRecorder_ object.\n\nAfter the recording is finished, we want to save this recorded media file to our\ncomputer. Drozer provides a method,\n[downloadFile](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/drozer/blob/c92d74024c653b6dc7de3378a24e51d276ae2c62/src/drozer/modules/common/file_system.py)\nexactly for this purpose. This method returns the length of the data downloaded\non success and `None` otherwise. We can use this information to test the success\nor failure of the fetching of the recording.\n\nThat's all. We have successfully implemented a Drozer module which can record\nthe sound on an Android device without the knowledge of the user. Do you smell\nsomething fishy here? The whole idea here depends on that particular\n`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO` permission that our agent app had. It allowed\nour module to record without _user consent_ (actually, the user gave her consent\nunknowingly while installing agent app). Many apps nowadays ask for arbitrarily\nrandom permissions. Those permissions might not be related to the functionality\nof the app in any way, but because there is no method to install apps without\ngranting these permissions, the users grant all permissions to these apps. That\ncan be exploited very easily. This tutorial tried to show one of such\nexploitations.\n\nHere are some exercises that you should try if you want to learn more about\nDrozer module development.\n\n- A module to initiate a call on a device.\n- A module to get the clipboard values on a device\n- Try finding a public exploit on Android forums such as XDA and implement that\n  exploit as a Drozer module.\n\nSlightly tougher one.\n\n- A module to terminate a call without user intervention (I do not know if it is\n  possible to do this programmatically. If you implement this successfully, do\n  let me know in the comments section.)\n\nThanks for reading. Cheers :)\n",

      "content_html": "\nI first heard about Google Summer of Code (GSoC) in my second year (2016). It\nwas quite fascinating to know that such a program exists (possibly because of\nthat super attractive amount of money, $5500 at that time). I researched about\nit and sent emails to some mentors. The replies were mostly encouraging, but I\nstill could not gather the courage to apply as I used to doubt my capabilities.\nThen last year (2017) again, I decided that I should try for GSoC one more time.\nI looked for the projects, started reading codebase of one project, but due to\nmy lack of determination, I again did not apply.\n\nIn the summers of 2017, I got some time to think about it. I decided that for\nthe next year, I will try everything to make sure that I apply for GSoC 2018. I\nstarted coding as much as possible and pushing my code to GitHub to build an\nimpressive profile.\n\nNow I can say that I am satisfied with my efforts to some extent. I did start\nsome good [open](https://github.com/yashhere/BeautifyMP3)\n[source](https://github.com/yashhere/ConMan)\n[projects](https://github.com/yashhere/Goofy). They are not very extraordinary,\nbut something is better than nothing. I dived into Debian packaging also and\nvolunteered for a FOSS event. Spreading awareness about FOSS is also\ncontributing to FOSS. Isn't it?\n\nComing back to GSoC, this year, I have successfully submitted a proposal to the\nDebian Project. It does not matter whether I get it or not. I overcame one of my\nbiggest fears of doubting my capabilities. It is something that I was trying to\ndo for the last two years. This moment is worth celebrating.\n\nRead about my GSoC project on\n[Boot Many Machines via Bittorrent](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2018/Projects#SummerOfCode2018.2FProjects.2FBootTorrent.Boot_many_machines_via_bittorrent).\nIt is related to something which I learned in [SSL](http://athena.nitc.ac.in/)\nas SSL admin.\n\nRead my project proposal on\n[Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/YashAgarwal/GSoCProposal).\n\n![gsoc timeline](/images/posts/gsoc-timeline.png \"gsoc timeline\")\n\nEagerly waiting for the results. :smile:\n\n**Update(24/04/2018)**: Finally, I did not get into GSoC this time too.

      "content_html": "\nI know I am very late in writing this post. It has been almost one and a half\nmonths since the last edition of FOSSMeet is over. I have been a part of\nFOSSMeet both as a participant and a volunteer. I want to share some of my\nobservations, views, and suggestions through this post. I intend to keep a\nmemory of my most favorite event of NIT Calicut. Juniors can read this post and\nthink about ways to improve FOSSCell and FOSSMeet. I did the same by reading\nKartik's\n[post](http://techglider.in/post/2013/04/14/of-fossmeets-at-nit-calicut/).\n\nBefore I start, if you have not read my _post_ on the 2017 edition of the\nFOSSMeet, it is a good time to read that first. This post is going to be a\nfollow up from where I stopped that post. [Here](/blog/fossmeet-17/) is the link\nto that post.\n\nI'll start by quoting some lines from the last paragraph of that article.\n\n> I hope that I will find time next year for FOSSMeet, although I would prefer\n> to attend FOSSMeet as a participant observing everything silently rather than\n> being a part of the organizing team.\n\nThese were my views after last year's FOSSMeet. I felt that I was not getting\nany benefit from volunteering for FOSSMeet. It is one thing that you help\nconducting an event, but on a personal level, I was not learning much. I wanted\nto attend talks and learn about free software philosophies, but because I was\nbusy volunteering for workshops in _SSL_, I could not participate in any\nlecture. So I wanted to make sure that in my last FOSSMeet, I do attend all the\ntalks and learn something new.\n\nBut fate had its plans for me. Few days after writing that post, Simsar, the\ncoordinator of FOSSMeet '17, came to my room and asked me if I would like to\nbecome the next secretary of FOSSCell. Those who don't know, FOSSCell is the\ngroup of people in NITC, who are supposed to work on free and open-source\ncontribution. But it is not very active for the last few years. Probably the\nseniors decided to give me a chance because I was quite active in providing my\nsuggestions for the FOSSCell when I was in the third year and had shown my\nintentions to reinitiate FOSSCell. Anyway, I was not very enthusiastic about\nthis opportunity and _refused_ to accept it. I thought that the topic was closed\nand did not bother about it much.\n\nFast forward two months, I was at home thinking about the reasons that I could\nnot get an internship were. I figured out some reasons (a topic reserved for a\nlater post!) and decided that whatever happens, I will not commit these mistakes\nagain. A few days later, Simsar messaged me on WhatsApp, asking whether I am\nstill interested in the post of secretary. This time, I immediately accepted his\noffer. I was under the influence of my learnings from past mistakes. And that's\nhow I became the unexpected (at least for my batchmates) secretary of FOSSCell.\n\nI was placed in the first few days of placement season, so I was free on that\nfront. CSEA had conducted a Debian packaging workshop at the very beginning of\nthe semester, but I could not attend that workshop. So I messaged Pirate Praveen\nsir privately and asked him whether he can guide me about Debian packaging. As\nwith most of the senior open source contributors, he was very enthusiastic about\nhelping me. So that's how I restarted my journey in open source. It was a fun\ntime learning about free software ideology from Pirate Praveen. We decided to\nconduct a small Debian Packaging hackathon in NITC. As it is a norm in CSE NITC\nnowadays about any such activity, people did not turn up at all for this\nhackathon. Only five people showed up for the hackathon. That was disappointing.\nThough, on a personal level, I was satisfied. I submitted two packages to the\nDebian unstable repository. We did not have any other activity for the remaining\nof that semester.\n\nOkay, enough of the background!\n\n## My Observations\n\nWe opted for the [HasGeek's Funnel](https://talkfunnel.com/) for the proposal\nacceptance this time also. The funnel works quite well for our workflow. We did\nnot get many [proposals](https://fossmeet-nitc.talkfunnel.com/2018/) in the\nbeginning. I had read somewhere on the web that FOSSMeet had a MiniDebConf once.\nThat seemed like an excellent idea to the team. So I talked with Praveen sir,\nabout the possibility of a separate Debian track during FOSSMeet. I thought that\nDebian packaging might be a good and easy way to introduce NITC students to\nOpen-source software.\n\nIn previous editions of FOSSMeets, the organizers used to receive the\n[feedback](http://techglider.in/post/2013/04/14/of-fossmeets-at-nit-calicut/)\nthat the student audience is entirely novice for some sessions and the\nsupposedly advanced session turned out to be a beginner session. We were well\naware of this problem and thought of a way to solve this. The solution may be a\ncontroversial one because even I have mixed feelings about this solution. We\ndecided to look at the GitHub profiles of each participant and then select a few\nparticipants rather than allowing each and everyone who is paying money to\nattend the FOSSMeet. Our experience from last year was awful in this aspect.\nStudents from various colleges of Kerala came to FOSSMeet just to get the\ncertificate. Such an audience was not contributing anything to FOSSMeet.\n\nNow, let me explain why I think that this is not the right way to filter good\nparticipants. If I am not wrong, one motive behind organizing such _student run\nconferences_ is to inspire beginners and college students to learn about free\nand open-source software and to allow them to learn about new technologies. Now,\nit should not matter if the person has any prior experience or not. In our case,\nwe prioritized the _previous experience_ part and neglected _the will to learn_.\nI know that it is tough to identify if a person is really interested in the\nevent or just coming for the certificate, but still, there must be some better\nway to solve this issue. For now, this method is the best option available, and\nit worked well enough for our purpose.\n\nThe decision to allow only 150 participants was an excellent move. We had\ndecided not to have parallel workshops and talks. This decision was a direct\noutcome of some of the bad feedback from the previous FOSSMeets. The decisions\nto check GitHub profiles and to restrict the number of participants made sure\nthat this edition of FOSSMeet has the most appropriate (read qualified) audience\nfor any session.\n\nWe publicized the event among CSED's first years. We even had a beginner level\nGit workshop for them. We were expecting that they will come to take part in the\nevent. These events provide excellent opportunities for newcomers to learn about\nComputer Science and its various fields. I used to give priority to a CSEA event\nover any cultural event when I was in my first year. But, the turnout of\nfirst-year students for FOSSMeet was very less. I sometimes worry, how are these\npeople going to continue organizing FOSSMeet. In the end, conducting this event\nwill become a burden (of carrying a legacy) for them, and they will hold this\nevent just like any other useless event that happens in NITC every weekend. We\neven made the entry, free for them; still, if they don't feel interested in the\nevent, then they are at an apparent loss.\n\nOne other complaint that we received from the community was that the procedure\nof selecting proposals from the funnel is not transparent. _In my opinion_, it\nis true. The organizing team of FOSSMeet sit together and choose the topics\nbased on the relevance of the topics and its relation to FOSS ideologies. Most\nof the proposals in the funnel were related to some technology or programming\nlanguage. We aimed to give a chance to the talks which explain more about free\nsoftware in general. Most of the proposals selected this year revolved around\nthis theme with one or two exceptions. But I think it might be a good idea to\npublicly tell the factors that are taken into account while selecting proposals.\nFOSSMeet is an event about free software and the community, and it is the\nresponsibility of the organizers to make sure that they adhere to the ideologies\nof free software, including transparency.\n\nThe decision to select philosophical topics might seem like a great thing.\nStill, in reality, the student audience is not very interested in listening to\nsome random guy preaching about something which is not very relevant to them.\nStudents want more technical knowledge, which they can get only from technical\ntalks and workshops. I hope that future FOSSMeet organizers will be more careful\nabout maintaining the right balance between technical and not technical\ndiscussions and workshops.\n\nSome students from Amrita college complained about our selection of the same\nspeakers every year. In my opinion, it is a very valid complaint. In my last\nthree FOSSMeets, almost 3-5 speakers are giving talks/workshops every year. I am\nnot saying that it is bad in any way, but the organizing team can start a bit\nearly and invite some other prominent faces of the field from different parts of\nthe country. The issue is that we begin contacting speakers very late and the\npeople coming from far corners of the country or from abroad get very little\ntime for making arrangements.\n\nWe used to have panel discussions in FOSSMeet. For the last two years, we\nstopped having one. I think that a panel discussion is a great way to learn\nabout different viewpoints of experienced people. It will be good if the future\norganizers can squeeze one such panel discussion in the FOSSMeet schedule.\n\nNow coming to my memories of this edition of the event, I liked the video\nconference by Bradley M Kuhn, the president of the Software Freedom Conservancy.\nThe way he explained current issues in software freedom was fascinating. I was\namazed by his humbleness. I was looking forward to the talk by RMS, but he could\nnot deliver his speech due to some technical issues.\n\n**On a lighter note**, It feels strange when you are working in a team where\neveryone except you speaks a language that you don't understand. I know that it\nis a very natural behavior, and I have no _complains_ about it. But in my\nopinion, language is a tool of communication, and when you are not able to\ncommunicate your views to others, then there is some problem. When I think about\nthese issues, I admire the forefathers of India for their farsightedness to make\na _foreign_ but _universal_ language, one of the official languages of the\nRepublic of India.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI feel at a loss because I got the chance to attend only three FOSSMeets (2015\nedition never came to reality). It has been a great experience both as a\nparticipant and a volunteer for me over the last three years. I have written two\nposts about FOSSMeets and have tried to cover everything which I liked or\ndisliked about this event. I might be very _biased_ in the views expressed here\nas I was very disappointed with the lack of any activity from the FOSSCell side\nto introduce students about open source contributions. My _lack_ of good\ncommunication skills made sure that the trend continues in my tenure also. I\nwish good luck to the next office bearers and hope that they will not continue\nthis trend. :smile:\n\nThanks to all fourth years -- Sajmal, **Navaneeth**, Nithin, Kumar, Pavithra,\nVrushabh, Nitin, and others for making the FOSSMeet a success. All the best to\nall juniors -- Abhiram, Archana, Olive, Amruth, Gazala, Abhirami, Anupam,\nMadhumita, Adil, Vysakh, Arun, and others. Special mention to some second years\nalso -- Nirmal, Faris, Darshana, Kavitha, Naina, Vishnu, and others for helping\nus out in a smooth organization of the event.\n\nFeeling relieved now, as this long overdue post is finally complete. If you find\nthe article interesting, share your views in the comments section. Thanks for\nreading. :relaxed:\n",

      "content_html": "\nToday, I deactivated my Facebook account again. For the last few days, I was\nfeeling that I am using Facebook excessively. It was affecting my work, my\n_public life_. I was using Facebook day in and day out. Today when I woke up in\nthe morning, I first opened Facebook and didn't leave my bed for one hour. I\nrealized that I had wasted one hour merely browsing through useless stuff.\nImmediately, I decided to deactivate the account for some time and analyze how\nmuch my life changes by one less distraction.\n\nCoincidentally, it is the time of [Ragam](http://ragam.org.in/Main/), the annual\ncultural festival of NIT Calicut. I _introspect_ myself every year at the same\ntime. For the last two years, this introspection is resulting in the\ndeactivation of my Facebook account. It is the reason why I could finish all my\npending projects in the summers.\n\nI sometimes feel that after coming to NITC, I have become much more socially\nawkward and even more of a loner than I was before. I never enjoyed going into\npublic events, but in college, that tendency seems to have increased a lot. Now,\nI do not feel comfortable with this state. I want to change this, but every time\nI try, there is some _invisible force_ which pulls me back from expressing\nmyself. NITC's environment was entirely different for a person like me, who\nalways preferred to stay alone. So, I built a _bubble_ around myself, where\nthere is no one to disturb or doubt me. It was okay in the initial years of my\ncampus life when circumstances were not in my favor, but now this bubble is an\nobstacle for me. I feel difficulty in coming out of this bubble.\n\nThere are only one and a half months left of my undergraduate life. I might not\novercome this fear at this time. But I hope that the change of environment will\nhelp me cross this barrier. I have learned a lot of lessons from my mistakes in\nthe past, and I hope that I will not repeat one of the biggest mistakes of my\nlife.\n\nI will write again about the changes I feel after deactivating Facebook. In the\nmeantime, I will try to spend more time with my friends and less on my laptop.\n:relieved:\n",

      "content_html": "\n_This article was originally published on\n[zeolearn](https://www.zeolearn.com/magazine/develop-a-theme-for-hugo)._\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial, I will show you how to create a basic Hugo theme. I assume\nthat you are familiar with basic HTML, and how to write content in markdown. I\nwill be explaining the working of Hugo and how it uses Go templating language\nand how you can use these templates to organize your content. As this post will\nbe focusing mainly on Hugo's working, I will not be covering CSS here.\n\nWe will be starting with some necessary information about the terminology used\nin Hugo. Then we will create a Hugo site with a very basic template. Then we\nwill add new templates and posts to our site as we delve further into Hugo. With\nvery slight variations to what you will learn here, you will be able to create\ndifferent types of real-world websites.\n\nNow, a short tutorial about the flow of this post. The commands that start with\n`$` are meant to be run in the terminal or command line. The output of the\ncommand will follow immediately. Comments will begin with `#`.\n\n## Some Terminology\n\n### Configuration File\n\nHugo uses a configuration file to identify common settings for your site. It is\nlocated in the root of your site. This file can be written in TOML, YAML or JSON\nformats. Hugo identifies this file using the extension.\n\nBy default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your `content/` directory and\ntemplate files in your `themes/` directory. It will create HTML files in your\n`public/` directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in\nthe configuration file.\n\n### Content\n\nThe content files will contain the metadata and text about your posts. A content\nfile can be divided into two sections, the top section being frontmatter and the\nnext section is the markdown that will be converted to HTML by Hugo. The content\nfiles reside in `/content` directory.\n\n### Frontmatter\n\nThe frontmatter section contains information about your post. It can be written\nin JSON, TOML or YAML. Hugo identifies the type of frontmatter used with the\nhelp of identifying tokens(markers). TOML is surrounded by `---`, YAML is by\n`---` and JSON is enclosed in curly braces `{` and `}`. The information in the\nfront matter of a content type will be parsed to be used in the template for\nthat specific content type while converting to HTML.\n\nI prefer to use YAML, so you might need to translate your configurations if you\nare using JSON or TOML.\n\nThis is an example of frontmatter written in YAML.\n\n```yaml\n---\ndate: \"2018-02-11T11:45:05+05:30\"\ntitle: \"Basic Hugo Theming Tutorial.\"\ndescription:\n  \"A primer about theme development for Hugo, a static site generator written in\n  Golang.\"\ncategories:\n  - Hugo\n  - Customization\ntags:\n  - Theme\n---\n```\n\nYou can read more about different configuration options available for\nfrontmatter [here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/#readout).\n\n### Markdown\n\nThe markdown section is where you will write your actual post. The content\nwritten here will automatically be converted to HTML by Hugo with the help of a\nMarkdown engine.\n\n### Templates\n\nIn Hugo, templates govern the way; your content will be rendered to HTML. Each\ntemplate provides a consistent layout when rendering the markdown content. The\ntemplates reside in the `/layouts` directory.\n\nThere are three types of templates: _single_, _list_ and _partial_. Each kind of\ntemplate take some content as input and transform it according to the way\ndefined in the template.\n\n#### Single Template\n\nA single template is used to render a single page. The best example of this is\n_about_ page.\n\n#### List Template\n\nA list template renders a group of related content. It can be all recent posts\nor all posts belonging to a particular category.\n\nThe homepage template is a specific type of list template. Hugo assumes that the\nhomepage will serve as a bridge to all the other content on your website.\n\n### Partials\n\nPartials are short code snippets that can be injected in any other template\ntype. They are instrumental when you want to repeat some content on every page\nof your website. The header and footer content are good candidates to be\nincluded in separate partials. It is a good practice to use partials liberally\nin your Hugo site as it adheres to\n[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle.\n\n## Okay, Let's Start\n\nSo now that you have a basic understanding of Hugo, we will create a new site\nusing Hugo. Hugo provides a command to generate new sites. We will use that\ncommand to scaffold our site. It will create a basic skeleton of your site and\nwill give you a basic configuration file.\n\n```yaml\n$ hugo new site ~/zeo $ cd ~/zeo $ ls -l total 28 drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts\n4096 Feb 11 11:13 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts   82 Feb 11 11:13\nconfig.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:13 content drwxr-xr-x 2\nyash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:13 data drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11\n11:13 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:13 static drwxr-xr-x 2\nyash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:13 themes\n```\n\n**Note:** I will use YAML format for the config file. Hugo, By default, uses\nTOML format.\n\nA small description of this directory structure:\n\n- **archetypes**: The archetypes contains predefined frontmatter format for your\n  website's content types. It facilitates consistent metadata format across all\n  the content of your site.\n- **content**: The content directory contains the markdown files that will be\n  converted to HTML and served to the user.\n- **data**: From Hugo documentation\n\n  > The data folder is where you can store additional data for Hugo to use when\n  > generating your site. Data files are not used to generate standalone pages;\n  > rather, they are meant to be supplemental to content files. This feature can\n  > extend the content in case your front matter fields grow out of control. Or\n  > perhaps you want to show a larger dataset in a template (see example below).\n  > In both cases, it is a good idea to outsource the data in their files.\n\n- **layouts**: The layouts folder stores all the templates files which form the\n  presentation of the content files.\n- **static**: The static folder will contain all the static assets such as\n  `CSS`, `JS` and `image` files.\n- **themes**: The themes folder is where we will be storing our theme.\n\nWe will edit the `config.yaml` file to edit some basic configuration of the\nsite.\n\n```sh\n$ vim config.yaml\nbaseURL: /\ntitle: \"My First Blog\"\ndefaultContentLanguage: en\nlanguages:\n  en:\n    lang: en\n    languageName: English\n    weight: 1\nMetaDataFormat: \"yaml\"\n```\n\nNow when you run your site, Hugo will show some errors. It is normal because our\nlayouts and themes directories are still empty.\n\n```sh\n$ hugo --verbose\nINFO 2018/02/11 11:20:59 Using config file: /home/yash/zeo/config.yaml\nBuilding sites … INFO 2018/02/11 11:20:59 syncing static files to /home/yash/zeo/public/\nWARN 2018/02/11 11:20:59 No translation bundle found for default language \"en\"\nWARN 2018/02/11 11:20:59 Translation func for language en not found, use default.\nWARN 2018/02/11 11:20:59 i18n not initialized, check that you have language file (in i18n) that matches the site language or the default language.\nWARN 2018/02/11 11:20:59 [en] Unable to locate layout for \"taxonomyTerm\":\n...\n...\n```\n\nThis command will also create a new directory called `public/`. This is the\ndirectory where Hugo will save all the generated HTML files related to your\nsite. It also stores all static data in this folder.\n\nLet's have a look at the `public` folder.\n\n```sh\n$ ls -l public/\ntotal 16\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb  11 11:22 categories\n-rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts  400 Feb  11 11:25 index.xml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts  383 Feb  11 11:25 sitemap.xml\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb  11 11:22 tags\n```\n\nHugo generated some XML files, but there are no HTML files. It is because we\nhave not created any content in our content directory yet.\n\nAt this point, you have a working site with you. All that is left is to add some\ncontent and a theme to your site.\n\n### Create a new theme\n\nHugo doesn't ship with a default theme. There are a lot of themes available on\nHugo website. Hugo also ships with a command to create new themes.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will be creating a theme called `zeo`. As mentioned\nearlier, my aim is to show you how to use Hugo's features to fill out your HTML\nfiles from the markdown content, I will not be focusing on CSS. So the theme\nwill be ugly but functional.\n\nLet's create a basic skeleton of the theme. It will create the directory\nstructure of the theme and place empty files for you to fill in.\n\n```sh\n# run it from the root of your site\n$ hugo new theme zeo\n$ ls -l themes/zeo/\ntotal 20\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:30 archetypes\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:30 layouts\n-rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts 1081 Feb 11 11:30 LICENSE.md\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:30 static\n-rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts  432 Feb 11 11:30 theme.toml\n```\n\nFill out `LICENSE.md` and `theme.toml` file if you plan to distribute your theme\nto outside world.\n\nNow we will edit our `config.yaml` file to use this theme.\n\n```sh\n$ vim config.yaml\ntheme: \"zeo\"\n```\n\nNow that we have an empty theme, let's build the site.\n\n```sh\n$ hugo --verbose\nINFO 2018/02/11 11:34:14 Using config file: /home/yash/zeo/config.yaml\nBuilding sites … INFO 2018/02/11 11:34:14 syncing static files to /home/yash/zeo/public/\nWARN 2018/02/11 11:34:14 No translation bundle found for default language \"en\"\nWARN 2018/02/11 11:34:14 Translation func for language en not found, use default.\nWARN 2018/02/11 11:34:14 i18n not initialized, check that you have language file (in i18n) that matches the site language or the default language.\n\n                   | EN\n+------------------+----+\n  Pages            |  3\n  Paginator pages  |  0\n  Non-page files   |  0\n  Static files     |  0\n  Processed images |  0\n  Aliases          |  0\n  Sitemaps         |  1\n  Cleaned          |  0\n\nTotal in 12 ms\n```\n\nThese warnings are harmless in our case, as we are developing our site in\nEnglish only.\n\nHugo does two things while generating your website. It transforms all the\ncontent files to HTML using the defined templates, and its copies static files\ninto the site. Static files are not transformed by Hugo. They are copied exactly\nas they are.\n\n### The Cycle\n\nThe usual development cycle when developing themes for Hugo is:\n\n- Delete the `/public` folder\n- Run the built-in web server and open your site in the browser\n- Make changes to your theme files\n- View your changes in browser\n- Repeat step 3\n\nIt is necessary to delete the `public` directory because Hugo does not try to\nremove any outdated files from this folder. So the old data might interfere with\nyour workflow.\n\nIt is also a good idea to track changes in your theme with the help of a version\ncontrol software. I prefer Git for this. You can use others according to your\npreference.\n\n### Run your site in the browser\n\nHugo has a built-in web server which helps considerably while developing themes\nfor Hugo. It also has a _live reload_ and _watch_ feature which watches for\nchanges in your files and reloads the web page accordingly.\n\nRun it with `hugo server` command.\n\nNow open [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) in your browser. By\ndefault, Hugo will not show anything, because it cannot find any HTML file in\nthe public directory.\n\nThe command to load web server with `--watch` option is:\n\n```sh\n$ hugo server --watch --verbose\n...\n...\n                   | EN\n+------------------+----+\n  Pages            |  4\n  Paginator pages  |  0\n  Non-page files   |  0\n  Static files     |  0\n  Processed images |  0\n  Aliases          |  0\n  Sitemaps         |  1\n  Cleaned          |  0\n\nTotal in 11 ms\n...\n...\n\n```\n\n### Update the Home page template\n\nHugo looks for following directories in theme's `/layout` folder to search for\n`index.html` page.\n\n- index.html\n- \\_default/list.html\n- \\_default/single.html\n\nIt is always desirable to update the most specific template related to the\ncontent type. It is not a hard and fast rule, but a good generalization to\nfollow.\n\nWe will first make a static page to see if our `index.html` page is rendered\ncorrectly.\n\n```html\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Hello World!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nBuild the site and verify the results. You should see _Hello World!_ when you\nopen [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).\n\n### Building a functional Home Page\n\nNow we will create a home page which will reflect the content of our site every\ntime we build it.\n\nFor that, we will first create some new posts. We will display these posts as a\nlist on the home page and on their pages, too.\n\nHugo has a command for generating skeleton of posts, just like it did for sites\nand themes.\n\n```sh\n$ hugo --verbose new post/first.md\nINFO 2018/02/11 11:40:58 Using config file: /home/yash/zeo/config.yaml\nINFO 2018/02/11 11:40:58 attempting to create \"post/first.md\" of \"post\" of ext \".md\"\nINFO 2018/02/11 11:40:58 curpath: /home/yash/zeo/archetypes/default.md\n...\n...\n/home/yash/zeo/content/post/first.md created\n```\n\nThe `new` command uses an archetype to generate the frontmatter for new posts.\nWhen we created our site, hugo created a default archetype in the `/archetype`\nfolder.\n\n```sh\n$ cat archetypes/default.md\n---\ntitle: \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\"\ndate: {{ .Date }}\n\n---\n```\n\nIt is a good idea to create a default archetype in the themes folder also so\nthat users can override the theme's archetype with their archetype whenever they\nwant.\n\nWe will create a new archetype for our posts' frontmatter and delete the default\n`archetype/default.md`.\n\n```sh\n$ rm -rf archetype/default.md\n$ vim themes/zeo/archetypes/post.md\n---\ntitle: \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\"\ndate: {{ .Date }}\nDescription: \"\"\nTags: []\nCategories: []\n\n---\n```\n\nCreate one more post in `content/post` directory.\n\n```sh\n$ hugo --verbose new post/second.md\nINFO 2018/02/11 12:13:56 Using config file: /home/yash/zeo/config.yaml\nINFO 2018/02/11 12:13:56 attempting to create \"post/second.md\" of \"post\" of ext \".md\"\nINFO 2018/02/11 12:13:56 curpath: /home/yash/zeo/themes/zeo/archetypes/post.md\n...\n...\n/home/yash/zeo/content/post/second.md created\n```\n\nSee the difference. Hugo used the theme's archetype for generating the\nfrontmatter this time.\n\nBy default, Hugo does not generate posts with an empty content section. So you\nwill need to add some content before you try to build the site.\n\nLet's look at the `content/post/first.md` file, after adding content to it.\n\n```sh\n$ cat content/post/first.md\n---\ntitle: \"First\"\ndate: 2018-02-11T11:35:58+05:30\ndraft: true\nTags: [\"first\"]\nCategories: [\"Hugo\"]\n\n---\n\nHi there. My first Hugo post\n```\n\nNow that our posts are ready, we need to create templates to show them in a list\non the home page and to show their content on separate pages for each post.\n\nWe will first edit the template for the home page that we created previously. We\nwill then modify \"single\" templates which are used to generate output for a\nsingle content file. We also have \"list\" templates which are used to group\nsimilar type of content and render them as a list. The home page will show a\nlist of last ten posts that we have created. Let's update its template to add\nthis logic.\n\n### Update your home page to show your content\n\nNow add your template code to `themes/zeo/layouts/index.html`.\n\n```html\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/index.html $ cat !$ cat themes/zeo/layouts/index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <body>\n    {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}\n    <h1>{{ .Title }}</h1>\n    {{ end }}\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nHugo uses Go Template Engine. This engine scans the templates for commands that\nare enclosed between `{{` and `}}`. In this template, the commands are `range`,\n`first`, `.Data.Pages`, `.Title` and `end`.\n\nThe template implies that we are going to get first 10 latest pages from our\ncontent folder and render their title as `h1` heading.\n\n`range` is an iterator function. Hugo treats every HTML file created as a page,\nso `range` will loop through all the pages created. Here we are instructing\n`range` to stop after first ten pages.\n\nThe `end` command signals the end of the _range_ iterator. The engine loops back\nto the next iteration as soon as it encounters the _end_ command. Everything\nbetween _range_ and _end_ will be evaluated for each iteration of the loop.\n\nBuild the website and see the changes. The homepage now shows our two posts.\nHowever, you cannot click on the posts and read their content. Let's change that\ntoo.\n\n### Linking your posts on Home Page\n\nLet's add a link to the post's page from home page.\n\n```html\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <body>\n    {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}\n    <h1>\n      <a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a>\n    </h1>\n    {{ end }}\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nBuild your site and see the result. The titles are now links, but when you click\non them, it takes you to a page which says `404 page not found`. That is\nexpected because we have not created any template for the single pages where the\ncontent can be rendered. So Hugo could not find any template, and it did not\noutput any HTML file. We will change that in a minute.\n\nWe want to render the posts, which are in `content/post` directory. That means\nthat their section is post and their type is also post.\n\nHugo uses section and type information to identify the template file for each\npiece of content. It will first look for a template file which matches the\nsection or type of the content. If it could not find it, then it will use\n`_default/single.html` file.\n\nSince we do not have any other content type yet, we will just start by updating\nthe `_default/single.html` file.\n\nRemember that Hugo will use this file for every content type for which we have\nnot created a template. However, for now, we will accept that cost as we do not\nhave any other content type with us. We will refactor our templates to\naccommodate more content types, as we add more content.\n\nUpdate the template file.\n\n```html\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/_default/single.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>{{ .Title }}</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>{{ .Title }}</h1>\n    {{ .Content }}\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nBuild the site and verify the results. You will see that on clicking on `first`,\nyou get the usual result, but clicking on `second` still produces the\n`404 page not found` error. It is because Hugo does not generate pages with\nempty content. Remember I mentioned it earlier.\n\nNow that we have our home page and posts page ready, we will build a page to\nlist all the posts, not just the recent ten posts. This page will be accessible\nat [http://localhost:1313/post](http://localhost:1313/post). Currently, this\npage is blank because there is no template defined for it.\n\nThis page will show the listings of all the posts, so the type of this page will\nbe a list. We will again use the default `_default/list.html` as we do not have\nany other content type with us.\n\nUpdate the list file.\n\n```html\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/_default/list.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <body>\n    {{ range .Data.Pages }}\n    <h1><a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a></h1>\n    {{ end }}\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Add \"Date Published\" to the posts\n\nIt is a standard practice to add the date on which the post was published on the\nblog. The front matter of our posts has a variable named `date`. We will use\nthat variable to fetch the date. Our posts are using the default _single_\ntemplate, so we will edit that file.\n\n```html\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/_default/single.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>{{ .Title }}</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>{{ .Title }}</h1>\n    <h2>{{ .Date.Format \"Sun, Feb 11, 2018\" }}</h2>\n    {{ .Content }}\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Adding top-level Pages\n\nOkay, so now that we have our homepage, post-list page and post content pages in\nplace, we will add a new _about_ page at the top level of our blog, not at a\nsublevel like we did for posts.\n\nHugo uses the directory structure of the content directory to identify the\nstructure of the blog. Let's verify that and create a new `about` page in the\ncontent directory.\n\n```yaml\n$ vim content/about.md\n---\ntitle: \"about\"\ndescription: \"about this blog\"\ndate: \"2018-02-11\"\n---\n### about me\n\nHi there, you just reached my blog.\n```\n\nLet's generate the site and view the results.\n\n```sh\n$ hugo --verbose\n$ ls -l public/\ntotal 36\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 12:43 about\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 12:43 categories\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:20 css\n-rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts  187 Feb 11 12:43 index.html\n-rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts 1183 Feb 11 12:43 index.xml\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:20 js\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 12:43 post\n-rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts 1139 Feb 11 12:43 sitemap.xml\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 12:43 tags\n```\n\nNotice that Hugo created a new directory `about`. This directory contains only\none file `index.html`. The about page will be rendered from `about/index.html`.\n\nIf you look carefully, the `about` page is listed with the posts on the\nhomepage. It is not desirable, so let's change that first.\n\n```html\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>posts</h1>\n    {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \"post\"}}\n    <h2><a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a></h2>\n    {{ end }} {{ end }}\n\n    <h1>pages</h1>\n    {{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \"page\" }}\n    <h2><a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a></h2>\n    {{ end }} {{ end }}\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNow build the site and verify the results. The homepage now has two sections,\none for posts and other for the pages. Click on the _about_ page. You will see\nthe page for _about_. Remember, I mentioned that Hugo would use the _single_\ntemplate for each page, for which it cannot find a template file. There is still\none issue. The _about_ page shows the date also. We do not want to show the date\non the _about_ page.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to fix this. We can add an if-else statement to\ndetect the type of the content and display date only if it is a post. However,\nlet's use the feature provided by Hugo and create a new template type for the\nposts. Before we do that, let's learn to use one more template type which is\n_partials_.\n\n## Partials\n\nIn Hugo, partials are used to store the shared piece of code which repeats in\nmore than one templates. Partials are kept in `themes/zeo/layouts/partials`\ndirectory. Partials can be used to override the themes presentation. End users\ncan use them to change the default behavior of a theme. It is always a good idea\nto use partials as much as possible.\n\n### Header and Footer partials\n\nHeader and footer of most of the posts and pages will follow a similar pattern.\nSo they form an excellent example to be defined as a partial.\n\n```html\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/partials/header.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>{{ .Title }}</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    $ vim themes/zeo/layouts/partials/footer.html\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nWe can call a partial by including this path in the template\n\n```go\n{{ partial \"header.html\" . }}\n```\n\n## Update the Homepage template\n\nLet's update our homepage template to use these partials.\n\n```html\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/index.html {{ partial \"header.html\" . }}\n\n<h1>posts</h1>\n{{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \"post\"}}\n<h2><a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a></h2>\n{{ end }} {{ end }}\n\n<h1>pages</h1>\n{{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if or (eq .Type \"page\") (eq .Type \"about\") }}\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\"\n    >{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}</a\n  >\n</h2>\n{{ end }} {{ end }} {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }}\n```\n\n## Update the single template\n\n```html\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \"header.html\" . }}\n\n<h1>{{ .Title }}</h1>\n<h2>{{ .Date.Format \"Sun, Feb 11, 2018\" }}</h2>\n{{ .Content }} {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }}\n```\n\nBuild the website and verify the results. The title on the posts and the about\npage should both reflect the value from the markdown file.\n\n## Fixing the date shown on About page\n\nRemember, we had the issue that the date was showing on the _about_ page also.\nWe discussed one method to solve this issue. Now I will discuss a more _hugoic_\nway of solving this issue.\n\nWe will create a new section template to fix this issue.\n\n```html\n$ mkdir themes/zeo/layouts/post $ vim themes/zeo/layouts/post/single.html {{\npartial \"header.html\" . }}\n\n<h1>{{ .Title }}</h1>\n<h2>{{ .Date.Format \"Mon, Jan 2, 2006\" }}</h2>\n{{ .Content }} {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }} $ vim\nthemes/zeo/layouts/_default/single.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>{{ .Title }}</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>{{ .Title }}</h1>\n    {{ .Content }}\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNote that we have changed the default _single_ template and added that logic in\npost's _single_ template.\n\nBuild the website and verify the results. The _about_ page does not show the\ndate now, but the posts page still show the date. We can also move the list\ntemplate's logic to the `index.html` file of post section template.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe have learnt, how Hugo harnesses the powerful yet simple Go template engine to\ncreate the static site generator. We also learnt about partials and their\nexcellent utilization by Hugo in the spirit of _Don't Repeat Yourself_\nprinciple. Now that you know how to make themes in Hugo, go ahead and start\ncreating new beautiful themes. Best of luck for your endaevour.\n",

My previous\ndomain, _yashagarwal.me_ that I got for free via GitHub education pack, was good\nenough for me, but the thought that I own a domain which is a top-level domain\nof some other country was in itself something which was not comfortable to me.\nSo when I got the chance to buy this domain, I didn't delay. Hope this domain\nwill remain my personal home on the web for years to come.\n\nThe domain is mapped with GitLab, and the SSL certificates are provided by\n[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Let's Encrypt requires you to renew\nthe SSL certificates every 90 days. That seems like a manual work to me.\nMoreover, my new registrar, GoDaddy, provides a complete API for their domain\nservices. So I am planning to write a script that utilizes the APIs of\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/help/api/README.md) and\n[GoDaddy](https://developer.godaddy.com/) to deploy the SSL certificates\nautomatically. I will probably use the DNS based authentication to verify the\nownership of my domain, as that seems the only method that does not require any\nmodification on the host side. I will write a post with all the details about\nthe script, once I finish implementing it.\n\nThat's all for this post. See you next time. :)\n",

      "content_html": "\nThis post is going to be one of those that I have written for my reference.\nWhatever I am going to mention in this post is not new. Everything has already\nbeen said and written many times on many websites and Linux forums.\n\nSo I will start by explaining the problem. When you try to dual boot your\nmachine to run both GNU/Linux and Windows operating systems, you might have\nnoticed that the time is not the same in both the operating systems. It is\ngenerally one operating system showing the correct time, and the other one\nshowing the wrong time. It happens because Microsoft Windows thinks that the\nhardware clock (CMOS clock or BIOS clock) of the machine is using the local time\n(depends on your current time zone), and hence it doesn't do anything and shows\nyou the same time. But most GNU/Linux operating systems (Ubuntu, Arch Linux,\netc.) think that the hardware clock is set to track UTC. Hence the mismatch in\nthe time happens. For example, assume that the current real-time is 10:22:51,\nand the hardware clock time is set to 10:22:51. Windows will interpret this time\nas local time and show 10:22:51, but Linux based systems will show 15:52:51\nbecause they will understand this time as UTC. Of course, the above example is\ntrue if we assume time zone as India, which is +05:30 from UTC.\n\nThis issue can be fixed either from Windows or from GNU/Linux OS. I prefer to\nadjust the behavior of Windows to use UTC. It is much more convenient to use\nwhen traveling between different time zones. Please note that this method might\nnot work or cause instability with older versions of Windows OS. I have tried\nthis fix on Windows 10, and it works without any issues.\n\nOpen an Administrator Command Prompt by pressing `⊞ + x`, then type `a`. This\nmethod of opening the Administrator Command Prompt does not work on Windows 7.\n\nNow execute the following command:\n\n```sh\nreg add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\TimeZoneInformation\" /v RealTimeIsUniversal /d 1 /t REG_DWORD /f\n```\n\nWindows Time Service, which keeps the clock in Windows OS accurate, will still\nwrite the local time to the Real-time clock (RTC) regardless of the registry\nsettings on shutdown. So I prefer to disable the Windows Time Service.\n\n```sh\nsc config w32time start= disabled\n```\n\nNow you may need to change the time in your BIOS to UTC time, although that\ndepends on whether your Windows OS was showing the correct time before applying\nthe above modifications. If yes, then changing BIOS time to UTC will make sure\nthat both Windows and GNU/Linux convert hardware clock to local time.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n1.

Many people ask me, why did I\nchoose to display a Sanskrit shloka on my blog.\n\nThere is no one answer to this question. There have been several incidents in my\nundergraduate life, which have given me a lot of good and evil memories. This\nshloka summarizes all those experiences that I earned in NIT Calicut during my\nundergraduate course. It reminds me, how I should treat others to receive\nsimilar treatment.\n\nIt was my first time away from home and family when I got admission in NIT\nCalicut. I was very naive about judging people. I got to know many new people in\nNITC. That is when I learned that not everyone is helping you. People are here\nto exploit you, and they will do anything to achieve their goals and to get\nsuccess, whether it comes at the price of someone else's loss. It is the harsh\ntruth of life, and the sooner one understands this, the better. I realized this\nin my second year, and that is when my life changed. Thankfully, I did not find\nother such people after my first year. However, life is very long, and I am\nbound to find such people at some point in my life again. I hope the experience\nthat I earned in NITC will help me face that time.\n\nNow, to the second part of the question, why Sanskrit? A quick Google search\nreveals that this shloka represents the concept of\n[Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule), which is common to\nmost world religions, and Hinduism is no exception here. There is even a\n[question](https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/21431/what-all-hindu-scriptures-advocate-the-golden-rule-and-what-is-the-oldest-hindu)\nabout the relation of this shloka with Hinduism. I studied Sanskrit for six\nyears till my 10<sup>th</sup> standard and feel a connection to it. Besides,\nHindi is my mother tongue, so Sanskrit was the obvious choice given that there\nis not much Hinduism related literature available in Hindi.\n\n**Edit(23/03/2018)**: I have removed the shloka from the front page now. I am\nkeeping this post for historical purpose.\n",

I am going to install some applications that I use on a day\nto day basis. Some of these applications are required for my current dotfile\n[configuration](/blog/my-own-configuration-manager/) setup to work properly. The\nchoice of applications is highly opinionated and your preferences might be\ndifferent.\n\nIf you had gone for installation via SSH option, then I would suggest you to\nedit your `sshd_config` file and disable `root` login. It can be a security risk\notherwise.\n\n### Install a terminal based browser\n\nTerminal-based browsers are very handy in cases when you are required to login\ninto a captive portal and you don't have access to a graphical browser. We will\ninstall two different browsers, `elinks` and `w3m`.\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S elinks w3m\n```\n\n### Install X server.\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S xorg\n```\n\nThis will install minimal X desktop environment with fonts, in case, you want to\ntest your system before installing any desktop environment.\n\n### Enable multilib repository for 32-bit package support\n\nTo enable multilib repository, uncomment the `[multilib]` section in\n`/etc/pacman.conf`.\n\n```bash\n[multilib]\nInclude = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist\n```\n\nNow upgrade your system.\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -Syyu\n```\n\n### Install video and touchpad drivers\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S xf86-video-intel xf86-input-synaptics\n```\n\n### Install pacaur to fetch and install packages from AUR\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S expac yajl --noconfirm\ncd /tmp\ngpg --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu:80 1EB2638FF56C0C53\ncurl -o PKGBUILD https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/plain/PKGBUILD?h=cower\nmakepkg -i PKGBUILD --noconfirm\ncurl -o PKGBUILD https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/plain/PKGBUILD?h=pacaur\nmakepkg -i PKGBUILD --noconfirm\ncd\n```\n\n### Install graphical browsers\n\n```bash\npacaur -S firefox chromium\n```\n\n### Install code editors\n\n```bash\npacaur -S sublime-text-dev atom-editor-git visual-studio-code-bin neovim neovim-drop-in leafpad\n```\n\n### Setup LAMP stack\n\n#### Install Apache server\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S apache\n\n# Make your user-directory available to apache server\nmkdir ~/public_html\nchmod o+x ~\nchmod o+x ~/public_html\nchmod -R o+r ~/public_html\n```\n\n```bash\n# To enable virtualhosts, uncomment the following line in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`\nInclude conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n```\n\nAdd your virtualhost configuration in following file -\n\n```bash\nsudo vim /etc/httpd/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n```\n\nTo test the virtual hosts on you local machine, add the virtual names to your\n`/etc/hosts` file.\n\n#### Install PHP:\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S php php-apache\n```\n\nTo use PHP with apache, open `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` and uncomment\nfollowing line -\n\n```bash\nLoadModule mpm_prefork_module modules/mod_mpm_prefork.so\n```\n\nand comment out the following line -\n\n```bash\n# LoadModule mpm_event_module modules/mod_mpm_event.so\n```\n\nNow add these lines to `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`:\n\n```bash\n# Add these at the end of `LoadModule` section.\nLoadModule php7_module modules/libphp7.so\nAddHandler php7-script .php\n\n# Place this at the end of the `Include` section:\nInclude conf/extra/php7_module.conf\n```\n\n#### Install MySQL server\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S mariadb\n\n# Initialize the MariaDB data directory prior to starting the service. To do so, run:\nsudo mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql\n\n# Then issue the commands to start the database server\nsudo systemctl enable mariadb.service\nsudo systemctl start mariadb.service\n\n# To apply recommended security settings to your database, run\nsudo mysql_secure_installation\n```\n\n#### Install PHPMyAdmin\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S phpmyadmin php-mcrypt\n```\n\nEnable `mysqli`, `mcrypt`, `zip` and `bz2` extensions in `/etc/php/php.ini`.\n\nCreate the apache configuration file `/etc/httpd/conf/extra/phpmyadmin.conf`\n\n```apache\nAlias /phpmyadmin \"/usr/share/webapps/phpMyAdmin\"\n<Directory \"/usr/share/webapps/phpMyAdmin\">\n    DirectoryIndex index.php\n    AllowOverride All\n    Options FollowSymlinks\n    Require all granted\n</Directory>\n```\n\nThen include following in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`\n\n```apache\n# phpMyAdmin configuration\nInclude conf/extra/phpmyadmin.conf\n```\n\nNow restart `httpd` service to apply settings.\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart httpd\n```\n\nOnce all these steps are done, your LAMP stack should be working.\n\n### Setup power management\n\nInstall `tlp` and some of its optional dependencies\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S tlp tlp-rdw bash-completion ethtool lsb-release smartmontools\n```\n\nThen enable `tlp` services\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl enable tlp.service\nsudo systemctl enable tlp-sleep.service\n\n# mask some services for tlp to work properly\nsudo systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.service\nsudo systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.socket\n```\n\n### Install i3 and other tools\n\nAll these tools are part of my `i3` config with exception of the theme related\npackages. So installing them here will help me later while setting up the `i3`\nwindow manager.\n\n```bash\npacaur -S i3 rofi polybar xautolock powerline-fonts-git i3lock-fancy-git compton scrot feh dunst unclutter xfce4-power-manager numlockx lxappearance adapta-gtk-theme gtk-engine-murrine gnome-themes-standard termite\n```\n\n### Fix Ugly Fonts [^1]\n\nFonts rendering is one area where Linux still lags behind Windows and OSX. It\ncan be a nightmare for users to setup fonts properly in Linux. In Arch Linux,\nthis is even worse. I found some tricks to improve the quality of font rendering\non Arch Linux. Though this is far from perfect, it is manageable. Follow these\n[steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/5r5ep8/make_your_arch_fonts_beautiful_easily/)\non Reddit to fix font rendering. I use Noto Sans, Adobe Source Code Pro, and\nMicrosoft fonts. My apologies, but I can't help here. Some websites still use\nMicrosoft fonts.\n\n### Setup Python Environment\n\nI use Python extensively and virtual environments are a must for my development\nsetup. I use `pipenv` to manage my virtual environments. To install `pipenv`,\nyou need to install `virtualenv` first. To install it, run the following\ncommand.\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S python-virtualenv\n```\n\nNow you are ready to install `pipenv`. Follow\n[here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to install the tool.\n\n### Install some other common tools\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S vlc openssh npm imagemagick git la-capitaine-icon-theme-git\n```\n\nDo not forget to\n[setup](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10081293/install-npm-into-home-directory-with-distribution-nodejs-package-ubuntu/13021677#13021677)\n`npm` to install packages globally without requiring `sudo`.\n\nThat's all! Your system should be in working condition now. Do check out my\n[dotfiles](/blog/my-own-configuration-manager/) if you want to set up your\nsystem like mine.\n\nHope you enjoyed the article.

      "content_html": "\nArch Linux is a Linux distribution known for its not-so-beginner-friendly\ncommand line installer, no ready-to-use system after installation and\nrequirement of above average knowledge of command line. However, Arch Linux\nallows me to set up a system in my desired state in shortest possible time with\nleast effort. This is why I keep coming back to Arch Linux even after some of\nits annoyances.\n\nThis guide is written primarily for my reference, as someone who has installed\nArch Linux several times, I still can't remember all the installation steps\nperfectly. Most of the steps have been taken from\n[Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide) and should\nwork on other setups also.\n\nAll the commands are run in root shell unless otherwise specified.\n\n## 0. Check your network connection\n\nIf you are behind a captive portal, use `links` to open browser and login into\nyour network. For WiFi connections, use `wifi-menu`. LAN connections should not\nrequire any setup. The boot environment should automatically detect any wired\nconnections. After connecting, test your connection by pinging any website:\n\n```bash\nping -c 5 google.com\n```\n\n## 1. Setup SSH\n\nThis step is not mandatory, though I prefer to use this method to install Arch\nLinux, as it provides me the convenience of copying and pasting the commands\ndirectly from Arch wiki.\n\nBy default the Arch Linux `root` account password is empty. We need to set up a\npassword for `root` account, which is needed for an SSH connection.\n\n```bash\npasswd\n```\n\nNow we need to change the setting to permit `root` login via SSH in\n`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Check that `PermitRootLogin yes` is uncommented in this\nfile. If this line is not present there, add this to the end. Now start the\n`sshd.service` by issuing the command\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl start sshd.service\n```\n\nAlso, note the IP address of the target machine by inspecting the output of the\nfollowing command.\n\n```bash\nip addr\n```\n\n_Pro tip:_ One liner to get only the IP address\n\n```bash\nip -o -4 addr show | awk -F '[ /]+' '/global/ {print $4}'\n```\n\nNow on your host machine, connect to the target machine via SSH using the\nfollowing command\n\n```bash\nssh root@ip-address-of-target\n```\n\n## 2. Partition the disks\n\nIf Windows 8 or above is already installed on your machine, then your hard disk\nis probably using `GPT` partitioning scheme. In that case, use `gdisk` to\npartition your hard disk. ~~If you use `fdisk` on a GPT partitioned HDD, there\nis a possibility of data loss.~~ `fdisk` understands `GPT` partitioning scheme\nalso.[1]\n\nMy preferred setup is to have one root partition and one home partition and use\n`EFI` partition created by Windows to install boot-loader. The root and home\npartition will be formatted using `ext4` file-system and the `EFI` partition\nshould be formatted using `FAT32` file-system.\n\nFor this guide, I am assuming that the `EFI` partition is `sda1`, root partition\nis `sda9` and home partition is `sda10`.\n\nNow to format the partitions with `ext4` file-system:\n\n```bash\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/sda9\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/sda10\n```\n\n## 3. Mount the partitions\n\nNow mount the root partition (`sda9` in this case) to `/mnt`\n\n```bash\nmount /dev/sda9 /mnt\n```\n\nIf you have created any other partitions in previous steps, mount them at\nappropriate locations.\n\n```bash\nmkdir /mnt/home\nmount /dev/sda10 /mnt/home\n\nmkdir /mnt/boot\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot\n```\n\n## 4. Install the base file-system\n\nTo install the base system and some development tools, issue the following\ncommand.\n\n```bash\npacstrap /mnt base base-devel\n```\n\nThis will take a while to download and install. After it finishes, it will give\nyou a bare-bone Arch Linux system with just the tools required to run a Linux\ndistribution, no other software is installed.\n\n## 5. Generate /etc/fstab\n\nThe `/etc/fstab` file stores the information about file systems of partitions\nand how to mount the partitions on system boot up. To generate this file, issue\nthe following command:\n\n```bash\ngenfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab\n```\n\nIf you prefer to use partition labels (sda1, sda9 etc.) instead of UUID, then\nuse `-L` flag in place of `-U`.\n\n## 6. chroot into the system\n\nFrom the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Change_root):\n\n> Chroot is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the\n> current running process and their children. A program that is run in such a\n> modified environment cannot access files and commands outside that\n> environmental directory tree. This modified environment is called a chroot\n> jail.\n\nAt this step, we will go to the root of the newly installed system at `/mnt` and\npretend as if we are logged into this system.\n\n```bash\narch-chroot /mnt\n```\n\n## 7. Setup the time zone, locale, and hostname\n\nBrowse the `/use/share/zoneinfo` directory to find your location entries. My\nlocation is India, so I will use this command.\n\n```bash\nln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime\n```\n\nTo set the hardware clock:\n\n```bash\nhwclock --systohc\n```\n\nTo set the locale for your system, open the `/etc/locale.gen` file and uncomment\nyour language. or run the following command for the default `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8`.\n\n```bash\nLANG=C perl -i -pe 's/#(en_US.UTF)/$1/' /etc/locale.gen\n```\n\nNow generate the localization with\n\n```bash\nlocale-gen\n```\n\nThen set the `LANG` variable in `/etc/locale.conf` accordingly, or run the\nfollowing command:\n\n```bash\nlocalectl set-locale LANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\n```\n\nTo set the hostname for your machine:\n\n```bash\nhostnamectl set-hostname your-host-name\n```\n\nTo allow other machines to address the host by name, it is necessary to edit the\n`/etc/hosts` file to look like this:\n\n```bash\n127.0.0.1    localhost.localdomain          localhost\n::1          localhost.localdomain          localhost\n127.0.1.1    your-host-name.localdomain     your-host-name\n```\n\n## 8. Create user account\n\nBefore creating user account, set password for `root` account\n\n```bash\npasswd\n```\n\nNow create a local account for your user\n\n```bash\nuseradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash your-user-name\n```\n\nThis will set up your user account, create a home directory for your user, set\nthe default shell to `bash` and add your user to `wheel` group, which is\nnecessary to gain `sudo` access in later steps.\n\nSet password for your user.\n\n```bash\npasswd your-user-name\n```\n\n## 9. Enable sudo access\n\nThis allows you to use root privileges without using the root account. To enable\nthis, first open `/etc/sudoers` file\n\n```bash\nnano /etc/sudoers\n```\n\nNow uncomment the following line to enable `root` privilege for all the users\ninside `wheel` group:\n\n```bash\n# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL\n```\n\nNow you can safely disable root account\n\n```bash\npasswd -l root\n\n# login into your user account\nsu your-user-name\n```\n\nFrom this point onwards, it is necessary to append `sudo` to any command that\nrequires `root` privileges.\n\n## 10. Install bootloader\n\nMy preferred bootloader of choice is `grub`. To install `grub`, we need to\ninstall following packages.\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S grub efibootmgr\n```\n\nNow install `grub` with the following command.\n\n```bash\nsudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=arch\n```\n\nHere `--efi-directory` is the folder where the `EFI` partition is mounted\n[step 3](#step3) and `--bootloader-id` is the label that will appear in your\nUEFI boot menu entry.\n\nThis particular step is specific to my machine's hardware, you might not need to\nrun this step. I need to add `pci=nommconf` to my kernel boot parameters in\n`/etc/default/grub`, otherwise `tty` prints error messages continuously.\n\nNow run to generate grub configuration file.\n\n```bash\nsudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n```\n\nIf you encounter any errors related to `lvm` during installation of grub, then\nfollow these steps.\n\n```bash\n# come out of chroot\nexit\nmkdir /mnt/hostrun\nmount --bind /run /mnt/hostrun\n\n# back to chroot\narch-chroot /mnt\nmkdir /run/lvm\nmount --bind /hostrun/lvm /run/lvm\n```\n\nNow you can install `grub` without any errors.\n\n## 11. Configure the network\n\nBy default, your current system cannot connect to the network in the current\nstate. I prefer to use\n[NetworkManager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager) for my\nnetwork management, even when I am not using GNOME. For wireless networking,\ninstall the following additional packages.\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant dialog networkmanager network-manager-applet dhclient\n```\n\n`NetworkManager` supports basic DHCP configuration. For full support, I have\ninstalled `dhclient`. `NetworkManager` also supports automatic wired connection\ndetection and comes with curses based tool `nmtui` to setup wireless connection.\n\nTo enable NetworkManager to start at system startup\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl enable NetworkManager.service\n```\n\n## 12. Reboot now\n\nIf you had performed the `lvm` troubleshooting steps during `grub` install, then\n\n```bash\numount /run/lvm\n```\n\nNow exit from `chroot` by typing `exit` in the shell. Unmount all the mounted\npartitions with:\n\n```bash\numount -R /mnt\n```\n\nFinally, reboot your machine by typing `reboot` and remove the installation USB\ndrive. If you are not able to boot into your system at this point, boot from the\ninstallation media again and attempt to fix the installation.\n\nIf you can see a terminal with a prompt for your username, congratulations! You\nhave completed the first step towards building your own system.\n\nI will be writing about making your system usable and stable in the\n[second](/blog/arch-linux-installation-part-2/) part of this guide.\n\nHope you enjoyed the post. Stay tuned :)\n",

      "content_html": "\nI have been using Linux since I was in my second year of undergraduate. My\nexperiments with the dotfiles (configuration files) also started at the same\ntime. For the uninformed, in Linux, it is common to configure a lot of settings\nand configurations within dotfiles. Dotfiles are files in a Linux user's home\ndirectory that begin with a dot or a full-stop character. This dot indicates to\nthe operating system that these files are used to store the settings of programs\nlike `vim` or shells like `bash` or `fish` to name a few.\n\nIn the beginning, I was keeping a manual backup of my dotfiles by copying them\nto a folder from time to time. But the list soon started getting huge, that it\nbecame complicated for me to keep track of the changes. Then I moved to\nsymlinks. I started symlinking all the dotfiles from my folder to their usual\nlocations. This setup worked perfectly fine, but as my collection of dotfiles\ngrew, It became very cumbersome for me to symlink every dotfile manually.\n\nI also tried a few tools built for this particular purpose. Some of them are\n`vcsh`, `mr`, and `stow`. These tools work just fine, but I was not willing to\nlearn new tools just for maintaining my dotfiles. At last, I decided to write my\ntool to solve this problem. This way, there will not be any external dependency,\nand this tool will also become part of my dotfiles.\n\n## Design\n\nThe tool, in itself, is inspired by the\n[UNIX tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file#UNIX/Linux) of\nkeeping configuration files for the settings of the programs. This configuration\nsystem uses a JSON formatted dotfile.\n\n[Here](https://github.com/yashhere/ConMan) is the source code for the\nconfiguration system. Let's have a look at the file structure of the repository.\n\n```sh\n|-- .backups\n|   |-- 08-01-2018-15:47\n|   |-- 08-01-2018-19:30\n|   |-- ......\n|-- configure.py\n|-- current_status\n|-- dotfiles\n|   |-- dunst\n|   |-- gtk-3.0\n|   |-- i3\n|   |-- ......\n|-- dotfiles.json\n|-- LICENSE\n`-- README.md\n```\n\nDuring the initial setup, you need to edit the `dotfiles.json` file to suit your\nsetup. A relevant section of the JSON file is given below.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pre\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"cloning repository\",\n      \"command\": \"git\",\n      \"subcommand\": \"clone\",\n      \"argument\": \"https://github.com/yashhere/dotfiles.git\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"linking\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"bashrc\",\n      \"src\": \"dotfiles/.bashrc\",\n      \"dest\": \".bashrc\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"bash_profile\",\n      \"src\": \"dotfiles/.bash_profile\",\n      \"dest\": \".bash_profile\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"profile\",\n      \"src\": \"dotfiles/.profile\",\n      \"dest\": \".profile\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"i3\",\n      \"src\": \"dotfiles/i3\",\n      \"dest\": \".config/i3\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAs can be seen, the JSON file has an array variable `linking`, which can be used\nto set the paths for each configuration file and folder. The `configure.py`\nscript also requires a `dotfiles` folder to be present in the current directory.\nThe folder can be created manually, or if it is already version controlled on\nGitHub, then the script can clone it. For that, you can edit the `pre` section\nin the `dotfiles.json`.\n\nYour dotfiles and config folders go inside the `dotfiles` folder. You need to\ncopy all your current configurations to this folder to get started.\n\nSo, how does the script know where a file or folder will be linked? Simple, you\nneed to edit the `dotfiles.json` file and add source and destination locations.\nFor example, if you want to set up configurations of `i3` to its original\nlocation (which is, `$HOME/.config/i3`), then you need to create a new JSON\nobject in the `linking` array, like this.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"i3\",\n  \"src\": \"dotfiles/i3\",\n  \"dest\": \".config/i3\"\n}\n```\n\nHere the `name` is used to identify the configuration file, the `src` parameter\nis the location of your config file/folder in the dotfiles directory, and the\n`dest` parameter is the final destination of the file/folder. Keen observers\nwould notice that I have not used `$HOME` anywhere. It is understood that the\nconfiguration will go to the current user's home directory. So the `dest` is\nrelative to the user's home directory, and `src` is relative to the directory\nfrom which the `configure.py` script is executed.\n\nAnd you are done! Now, run `configure.py`, and all your dotfiles and folders\nwill be symlinked to their correct place.\n\nThe `current_status` file saves all the symlink locations that are being managed\nby the script, for your easy reference and to debug any error.\n\n## Behind the Scenes\n\nA lot to cool things happen behind the scenes. The script will check if any\nprevious symlink exists at the given `dest` location. It removes any symlinks to\navoid redundancy. If the dest already has any dotfile or folder, then it backs\nit up in the `.backups` under today's date and time before replacing it with a\nsymlink to avoid any potential data loss.\n\nI hope the article was useful.

      "content_html": "\nIf I have to define 2017 in one word, that would be amazing. This year has been\na life-changing year for me. I learned a lot of new things, had some excellent\nexperience in the company of amazing people, had a great time in my academic\nlife and SSL. 2017 has been a very significant year for me, and I want to record\nthis memory by documenting some of the most amazing things that I learned and\nexperienced this year.\n\n## Grades\n\nAlthough I cared very little for grades for the most of my college life, this\nyear changed my perception of grades. I finally understood that the grades are\nalso equally important. I started _2017_ with only one goal --- getting good\ngrades. I studied a lot in the first half of the year, and it is because of that\ntime, I hold an excellent command over Computer Networks. If I have to choose\nany one semester for my placement, It would be 6th semester.\n\nI invested most of my time for preparation of campus placements in the mid of\nthe year. Reading Data Structures and Algorithms have proven to be very\nbeneficial for me. However, the way I studied Data Structures, hasn't improved\nmy skills in real-world problem-solving skills.\n\nI did not do exceptionally well in academics in the late half of the year.\nPartly because of the _after placement_ and _\"Dude, it is fourth year\"_ type of\nenvironment around me. My final year project did not go in the right direction,\nand it is one of the very few disappointments for me in _2017_.\n\n## Coding\n\nIt is one thing which I could never excel in my undergrad life. People say that\ncoding is a skill and it requires practice. However, to continue doing that\npractice, one needs patience, that, unfortunately, I lack. This year continued\nto be the same as 2016. I could not overcome my fear of coding. I tried doing\nsomething different in the form of\n[#100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode), but couldn't continue it\nafter 20 days because of my preparations for campus placements. I have again\nstarted writing code on a regular basis in late December. Looking forward to\ncode more frequently in 2018.\n\nRecently I started working on Debian Packaging.\n[Praveen](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=praveen%40debian.org) sir\nhas always been very supportive of me and answered all my ludicrous questions\nvery patiently. My conversation with him about free software philosophy has been\nvery enlightening. Debian Packaging was a very satisfying experience to be able\nto give something back to the community. Now, I hold\n[one](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=yashagarwaljpr@gmail.com)\npackage in the unstable Debian repository and\n[two](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=bansaly26@gmail.com) more\npackages in the pipeline for approval.\n\n![Working on my first Debian package](/images/posts/HackFest1.jpg \"Working on my first Debian package\")\n\n![Praveen sir and team](/images/posts/HackFest2.jpg \"Praveen sir and team\")\n\n## Placement\n\nI joined NIT Calicut due to many\n[reasons](https://dsanghi.blogspot.com/2011/05/my-2011-list-of-recommended-csit.html).\nPlacements were undoubtedly one of the most important of them. Fortunately, I\nwas among first few students to get placed in my batch. That moment came with a\ngreat relief in my life.\n\n![A private post on FB, now public](/images/posts/placement.png \"A private post on FB, now public\")\n\n## Reading\n\nI had started this year with an aim to read ten books and keep track of my\nreading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/8390620). In\nthe end, I could not finish my goal. I did occasionally try to meet my goal, but\nmy excessive reliance on soft copies of the books always distracted me. Now, it\nis not a surprise that I am unable to read anything on a screen. I got three\nhard copy books and finished two of them. However, I could not go past more than\n20 pages of any digital book, that I bought on Kindle.\n\n## Writing\n\nI have not written for the most of the year. I do think about writing\noccasionally and keep a note of all the ideas that I get. However, due to my\nbusy schedule and my usual procrastination, I do not write that often. In 2018,\nI will try to write more often.\n\n## Health\n\nIt is one issue where I do not put enough stress. I can divide my year into two\nparts for this portion. Pre Birthday half and post Birthday half. I maintained a\ndaily exercise routine for the first half of the year. That helped me in many\nways. I felt more energetic, more productive and more resolute to troubles in\nlife. I slept at ten each day and woke up early morning. It resulted in\nexcellent health, which I had always lacked.\n\nHowever, the second half of the year was disastrous. Due to weather and other\nunavoidable circumstances, I could not keep up my routine; once I came back to\ncollege. I started sleeping late again, and that resulted in me going to docter\nvery often in the last two months.\n\n## Relations\n\nI continued to feel bored in the company of people. It is somewhat strange that\nafter getting into college, year by year, my interest in public events has\ndecreased gradually. It may be because of the difference in my understanding of\nhappiness and that of others.\n\nI built good relations with some faculties in the\n[department](http://cse.nitc.ac.in/), my technical skills got me some admirers,\nwho eventually became my _friends_. I made some new friends from MCA also this\nyear. It has been a pleasant experience overall.\n\n**_Looking forward to 2018 for, full of new experiences!_**\n",

      "content_html": "\nIn this post, I will write about the procedure to correctly setup SSH and GPG\nagents in the i3 window manager. To follow this post, you need to have ssh-keys\nand your private GPG keys ready. If you do not already have these keys with you,\nI will describe the process of creating the keys.\n\n## SSH\n\nGenerating an SSH key pair provides you with a public key and a private key. The\nprivate key should never be given to anyone and public key, well the name itself\nis self-explanatory.\n\nTo create a new key pair, open a terminal and paste the text below.\n\n```sh\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email_address\"\n```\n\nThis command will create a new ssh key pair with the given email address as the\nlabel. Press Enter for any question asked. When it asks for the passphrase, type\na strong passphrase, otherwise leave it blank to have no password.\n\n## GPG\n\nYou might need to download the GPG command line tools before following the below\nsteps. Follow your distribution's documentation for more help.\n\nOnce you have downloaded the tools, open a terminal, and type the following\ncommand.\n\n```sh\ngpg --gen-key\n```\n\nYou will see something like this. Enter 1 to select the default key choice.\n\n```text\ngpg (GnuPG) 1.4.20; Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\ngpg: directory `/home/yash/.gnupg' created\ngpg: new configuration file `/home/yash/.gnupg/gpg.conf' created\ngpg: WARNING: options in `/home/yash/.gnupg/gpg.conf' are not yet active during this run\ngpg: keyring `/home/yash/.gnupg/secring.gpg' created\ngpg: keyring `/home/yash/.gnupg/pubring.gpg' created\nPlease select what kind of key you want:\n   (1) RSA and RSA (default)\n   (2) DSA and Elgamal\n   (3) DSA (sign only)\n   (4) RSA (sign only)\nYour selection?\n```\n\nAt the next prompt, enter the key size. It is recommended to use the maximum key\nsize of 4096 bits.\n\nEnter the time duration for which the key should remain valid. Press Enter to\nspecify the default selection, indicating that the key does not expire.\n\nAfter verifying the information, enter your user information and a strong\npassphrase. Afterward, GPG will start generating your key. You will see:\n\n```text\nWe need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse,\nutilize the disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.\n```\n\nYou can now use the key (until it expires) to encrypt your data.\n\n## Setting up SSH Agent\n\n### Configuring i3\n\n**Update (26/05/2018):** _As pointed out by\n[Saksham](https://sakshamsharma.com/) in the comments below, this step is not\nrequired for the setup of SSH in i3. This step can be safely ignored._\n\nOpen i3 configuration file and add an `exec_always` statement -\n\n```sh\nexec_always ~/.config/i3/scripts/gnome-keyring.sh\n```\n\nObviously, you will need to change the path according to your OS. Now make a new\nfile in `~/.config/i3/scripts` with name `gnome-keyring.sh` and paste the below\ntext in it.\n\n```sh\neval $(/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=gpg,pkcs11,secrets,ssh)\nexport GNOME_KEYRING_CONTROL GNOME_KEYRING_PID GPG_AGENT_INFO SSH_AUTH_SOCK\n```\n\n(Assuming that you already have installed gnome-keyring)\n\nNow, reload the i3.\n\n### Configuring SSH\n\n**Update (26/05/2018):** _This step is also optional. Thanks to\n[Saksham](https://sakshamsharma.com/) for pointing it out._\n\nOpen `~/.ssh/config` file and add following content to it -\n\n```sh\nHost *\n  AddKeysToAgent yes\n  IdentityFile /home/<your username>/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n\nReplace \\<your username\\> accordingly.\n\n### Setting up .bashrc\n\nI am not using a login shell, and I could not find any suitable method to source\n`~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile` on login in i3. So I added my configuration to\n`~/.bashrc` file. I know it is a hack, but it works well for me without much\nheadache.\n\nOpen `~/.bashrc` file and add following lines to the end of the file.\n\n```bash\nif [ -f ~/.ssh/agent.env ] ; then\n    . ~/.ssh/agent.env > /dev/null\n    if ! kill -0 $SSH_AGENT_PID > /dev/null 2>&1; then\n        echo \"Stale agent file found. Spawning a new agent. \"\n        eval `ssh-agent | tee ~/.ssh/agent.env`\n        ssh-add\n    fi\nelse\n    echo \"Starting ssh-agent\"\n    eval `ssh-agent | tee ~/.ssh/agent.env`\n    ssh-add\nfi\n```\n\nIt will automatically start an `ssh-agent` if it is not already running.\nOtherwise, it attaches to a previously running agent.\n\nNow log out and log in again to see if ssh-agent works. Open a terminal and run\nthe command `ssh-add -l`. It will show you the hash value of your ssh-key, which\nis loaded by the ssh-agent.\n\nThat is all for today. Thank you for reading!\n",

      "content_html": "\nRecently, I got a chance to set up ALM Octane on one of my university servers\nfor a course project. From the support page of ALM Octane:\n\n> ALM Octane is a web-based application lifecycle management platform that\n> enables teams to collaborate easily, manage the product delivery pipeline, and\n> visualize the impact of changes.\n\n## Precursor\n\nMy [department](http://cse.nitc.ac.in/) insists on using open-source software (a\nplus point, indeed!). But ALM Octane has Oracle DB/MSSQL as a dependency. My\nprofessor was not very enthusiastic about installing a proprietary database on\nthe server. So I came up with a different approach. I set up this database\n([free version](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/xe.html) of\nOracle DB, the Oracle Database 11g Express Edition) in a Docker container. ALM\nOctane has three components -- Oracle DB, Elastic Search, and the Octane Server\nitself. The problem was to handle the condition that these three components\nshould be installed on different machines. I decided to use three separate\nDocker containers for this isolation and then configured them to communicate\nwith each other with docker-compose.\n\n### Wait ... Docker Compose?\n\n(Skip this if already know about Docker and Compose)\n\n> Docker-compose is a tool to define and run multi-container Docker\n> applications. Compose uses a compose file to configure the services used by\n> the applications. Then all the services and the application can be run by\n> using a single command.\n\nSo before reading this article any further, if you do not know about\ndocker-compose, go and read about it.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThree primary services are required for the proper functioning of the Octane\nServer -- Octane, Oracle DB and Elastic Search. The difficulty was to set up\nadequate configuration options for these services and the appropriate setup for\ncommunication between them. I searched on Docker Hub for any pre-built images.\nFortunately, I found some pre-built Docker images for my purpose. So I started\nwriting my config file.\n\n## The Solution\n\nHere is my config file for easy reference.\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"2\"\nservices:\n  octane_oracle:\n    image: alexeiled/docker-oracle-xe-11g\n    shm_size: 2g\n    mem_limit: 4g\n  octane_es:\n    image: elasticsearch:2.4\n    environment:\n      - ES_HEAP_SIZE=4G\n    mem_limit: 4g\n  octane:\n    image: hpsoftware/almoctane\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n    volumes:\n      - /opt/octane/conf:/opt/octane/conf\n      - /opt/octane/log:/opt/octane/log\n      - /opt/octane/repo:/opt/octane/repo\n    links:\n      - octane_oracle\n      - octane_es\n    mem_limit: 4g\n    env_file:\n      - ./octane.env\n```\n\nThe configuration options in the code are for a system with RAM of 8GB. The\noptions must be tuned for the best performance before deploying on the\nproduction server.\n\nIn the code, I have exposed port `8080` of the Octane Docker container to the\nport 8080 of the host machine. It will make sure that we can access the Octane\napplication on `localhost:8080`. The `octane.env` file contains three variables\nfor easy site management.\n\n```sh\nSERVER_DOMAIN=\"your domain name\"\nADMIN_PASSWORD=\"your password\"\n#This disables the minimum memory check to enable to run on smaller machines.\nDISABLE_VALIDATOR_MEMORY=true\n```\n\nNow, if you try to run the container with `docker-compose up`, you will\nencounter various validation errors. It is because, before starting the server,\nyou need to adjust some settings. If you noticed in the config file, there is a\nsection to define volumes. These volumes are persistent and are used to keep\nchanges saved between two docker-compose runs. I have mapped three volumes from\nthe Docker container to the host machine. So you can now edit the files in the\n`/opt/octane/` folder on the host machine, and changes will reflect in the\nDocker container. The file where you will have to make changes is\n`/opt/octane/conf/setup.xml`.\n\nYou can read the documentation of ALM Octane to find out which settings to be\nchanged. Once you do the necessary changes, fire up the command\n`docker-compose up` and wait for some time. Docker Compose will finish\nprocessing, and the server can be accessed on\n[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) on the host machine. While\ndeploying it on the production server, make sure that your network administrator\nhas opened the port 8080 for your server. Otherwise, the site will not be\naccessible. Also, the docker-compose can be run in the background by issuing\ncommand `docker-compose up -d`.\n",

Everything\nworked fine except WiFi and some minor bugs in Budgie(I don't know whether it is\na bug in Budgie or just a wrong setting). I also faced the problem of mounting\nWindows NTFS volumes on the user's wish. Arch Linux wiki has details about how\nto automount partitions on start-up. Still, I had a tough time to find out what\nexactly needs to be done to simulate the behavior of Ubuntu-like distribution on\nthe mounting of NTFS drives. I got a hint from Arch Linux Wiki about the Polkit\nconfiguration setting, which can be used to allow a standard user to mount\npartitions. Here is a solution that I found after a long search on various Arch\nLinux Community pages.\n\nYou will need to install `ntfs-3g`, `polkit` and `udisks2` to use this code.\nPlease refer to [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Udisks).\n\nI think when using Gentoo, you will also need to compile the support for the\nNTFS file system in Kernel also. Please see\n[here](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/NTFS).\n\nAdd the following code to `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/10-udisks2.rules` -\n\n```vim\n// Allow udisks2 to mount devices without authentication for users in the \"wheel\" group.\npolkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {\n    if ((action.id:= \"org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount-system\" ||\n        action.id:= \"org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount\") &&\n        subject.isInGroup(\"wheel\")) {\n            return polkit.Result.YES;\n        }\n    }\n);\n\npolkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {\n   if ((action.id:= \"org.freedesktop.udisks.filesystem-mount-system-internal\") &&\n        subject.isInGroup(\"wheel\")) {\n            return polkit.Result.YES;\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\nNow you will be able to mount NTFS partition without any problem. :)\n",

      "content_html": "\nOne more edition of FOSSMeet'17 was successfully organized in NIT Calicut\nrecently. As an active member of the organizing team of this year's edition\n(though I sidelined myself at the end) and a keen but silent observer, I want to\nshare my experience, ideas, and some observations through this post.\n\n## Marketing Website\n\nWe started planning the next edition of FOSSMeet sometime around September. Not\nmany people were interested in planning. Anyway, Shrimadhav and I began working\non the marketing website. The first design was straightaway rejected by Piyush\nand Simsar, which I feel, was fruitful. In the process, I learned some critical\ninsights about planning, team management, and design of a user-friendly website.\nSo I again started working on the site. The end product was clean, good looking,\nand simple (at least I was happy with it :P).\n\nIn the meanwhile, Amal and I started thinking about ideas, how can we\nrestructure the FOSSCell, which had not seen a single activity (except those\ntrademark events which were conducted just for formality) in years. I now\nunderstand that it was a mistake. It is a prerequisite about open source\ncontribution that you should contribute to the products which you use in day to\nday life. When we started thinking about the FOSSCell, we didn't know about any\nof these points. We conducted a formal test(more of a filtering process), then\nwe had a small meeting with the selected 2nd years about the FOSSCell, and we\ndiscussed the plan for next semester. Then everyone left for winter vacations.\n\n## A period of self-evaluation\n\nIn the winter holidays, we tried to have some IRC discussions, which again was\nsomewhat successful because of the efforts from Shrimadhav and Simsar. It was a\nnew experience for me also, but still, I tried to attend as much as I could. I\nalso took one session on Git and Vim, which again was an entirely new experience\nfor me.\n\nIn the winter vacation, I found some time to think about the purpose of FOSSMeet\nand FOSSCell and in what direction we were heading. I somehow understood that I\nwas not qualified enough to guide someone about open source contribution or in\ngeneral FOSS ideology, because I, myself was not contributing anything to open\nsource community, and had no characteristic of a FOSS enthusiast. So I somehow\nlost my interest in FOSSCell and even in Linux. Shrimadhav asked me my ideas\nabout FOSSCell activities, but I had no clue what to say. So that's how the\nFOSSCell again died without achieving anything significant. I feel it was my\nmistake. I still feel sad about this. :(\n\n## FOSSMeet time\n\nSo as the FOSSMeet's dates came near, people started coming for _volunteering_.\nIt was good for the event, though. The funnel was already up last semester, and\nwe were getting some good proposals also. FOSSMeet also went superbly. All the\nparticipants gave excellent reviews. There were some hiccups also, The Campus\nInternet Connectivity being the most significant one. There were some issues in\nSSL also, again, somewhere I hold an important responsibility. All in all,\neverybody praised the event and organization of the event. This year, we tried\nto reduce the use of plastics, and I feel that we were quite successful.\n\n## My Observations\n\nThere were some issues about the event, which I didn't like at a personal level.\nI sometimes think about what is the motive for conducting some activities in\ncolleges. An event like FOSSMeet which attract the attention of all FOSS\nenthusiasts from all over Kerala has a huge potential of inspiring the young\nfolks of NIT Calicut. We somehow succeed in that motive, but what about the\nsituation after FOSSMeet. The enthusiasm about FOSS should not last just for two\ndays, but we cannot blame others for the condition. I don't have a proper idea\nabout the FOSS because there was no proper guidance from my senior batches. I\nlearned many things in the workshops organized by CSEA, in fact, I first learned\nthe proper use of Linux Shell in the Linux workshop conducted by CSEA (and\nFOSSCell, at least for formality). But you can't ask them to do everything. I\nthink they are already overloaded. But there were no such workshops by FOSSCell.\n\nSecond, the curriculum of the NITC CSE department focuses more on the\ntheoretical side of Computer Science, which is good. But it negatively affects\nstudent activities outside the classroom. That is one of the primary reasons why\nwe cannot produce more GSoC participants or why don't we have more open source\nenthusiasts.\n\nThird, one of the speakers in FOSSMeet mentioned one fundamental flaw in the\nstructure of the organizing team of FOSSMeet. It doesn't have any representation\nfrom other branches. FOSSMeet has become an event for CSE folks, where people\nfrom different departments do not take any interest. I think publicity was a\nmajor issue here. I don't believe that there was any publicity done to explain\nFOSSMeet to the students of other branches. (If I am wrong here, please correct\nme).\n\nFourth, people are ready to _volunteer_ for organizing an event, but they do not\nwant to come and attend the workshops. FOSSMeet is held by individuals who have\nno previous experience of FOSS and have no intention to dive into open source\ncommunity any time soon. FOSSMeet has become a tradition that is continued every\nyear because it happened the previous year also. I do not feel that enthusiasm\nto promote FOSS in FOSSMeet because we are organizing it to keep the legacy. I\nam not saying that whatever effort organizers put in conducting FOSSMeet'17 was\nnot significant. I am not the right person to blame them because I was also part\nof the same team. But still, I feel that FOSSMeet has lost its original motive\nto promote FOSS culture in NITC. It encourages more people from outside NITC,\nbut inside NITC, it is just one of those many events organized by random clubs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt's been an interesting one year for me after becoming SS Lab Admin because I\nstarted taking part in department activities that I always wanted to do. Being a\nmember of the organizing team of FOSSMeet'17 was again a learning experience for\nme. I learned many new things, in SSL and outside SSL too. I committed some\nmistakes also in making the right decisions at the right moment, but that's how\nI learn. So no regrets. :) I hope that I will find time next year for FOSSMeet,\nalthough I would prefer to attend FOSSMeet as a participant observing everything\nsilently rather than being a part of the organizing team.\n",

      "content_html": "\nRecently, I again migrated my blog from Pelican to Hugo. So till now, I have\nexperimented with Wordpress, Jekyll, Pelican, and Hugo. Without any doubt, Hugo\nis the simplest to set up. This time, I have setup Hugo in Windows, as I think,\nin my system, I reinstall Windows OS much less frequently than the Linux. So\nthat way, it will be less painful for me to set up the blog again.\n\nIn this post, I will list all the process which I used to set up automatic\ndeployment of Hugo generated site to Github pages using Wercker. In the\nbeginning, I was trying to use Travis-CI, but then I read about Wercker\nsomewhere. I was impressed with the integration of Wercker with Hugo and the\navailability of many its community-generated “steps” for the build and deploy\nprocess.\n\n[Hugo Docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/) already have a fantastic\n[documentation](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/deployment-with-wercker/)\nfor setting up Hugo with Wercker, but it is outdated. Other documentations\navailable on-line is also obsolete. Wercker has changed many functionalities in\nits platform, which made it difficult for me to set up things correctly. But\nafter hours of trial and error cycle, I was able to build and deploy my static\nfiles successfully.\n\nHere I would like to share the issues I encountered and the tweaks I’ve made.\nThe source codes of this site can be found\n[here](https://github.com/yashhere/yashhere.github.io).\n\n## Project Pages or User Pages\n\nTwo types of sites are supported on Github Pages, User Site, and Project Site.\nUser Sites will serve the files stored in the master branch of the repository\n`https://github.com/user_name/user_name.github.io` at the address\n`https://user_name.github.io.` For the Project sites, everything under the\ngh-pages will be served at the address `https://repo_name.github.io`.\n\nMy site is a User site, so I wanted all the static files to be saved in the\nmaster branch. As Hugo generates all the static files under `public` directory,\nI needed another branch to store my source files. So my made a new branch\n`source`, which will save all the source files for my blog. Don’t forget to\nremove the `.git` folder from the theme folder. Otherwise, the build will fail\nat a later stage. You can try using the git submodule feature to avoid this\nissue. I created a repository `yash2696.github.io` in Github also.\n\n```sh\ngit init                       #initialized git repository in site root\ngit checkout -b source         #created new branch source\ngit remote add origin [https://github.com/yash2696/yash2696.github.io](https://github.com/yashhere/yashhere.github.io)\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial Commit\"\ngit push origin source\n```\n\nThen I initialized my master branch as a orphan branch.\n\n```sh\ngit checkout --orphan master\ngit rm -rf .\nrm -f '.gitignore'\necho \"#Your repository name\" > README.md\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -a -m \"Initial Commit\"\ngit push origin master\n```\n\n## Automatic deployment using Wrecker\n\nIt is straightforward to build a Hugo site. Invoke `hugo` command under your\nroot directory, Hugo will create a public folder which will contain all your\ncontent, static files, etc. Then push this directory to Github, and voila, your\nsite is up!\n\nWhat if a single push to `source` branch can trigger all the process for you\nautomatically. Here the magic of continuous integration(CI) comes into the\npicture. A free Wercker account can be easily created and hooked to the Github\naccount and a new application from a chosen repository. After setting up\neverything, a push to the development branch will automatically trigger the\nWercker. One of the most significant advantages of using Wercker is its\nextensive collection of user-made and well documented \"steps\". In this post, I\nwill use two steps, `build hugo` and `deploy to Github`.\n\n![Wercker → Registry → steps](/images/posts/wercker-steps.png \"Wercker → Registry → steps\")\n\nThe first task is to create a `wercker.yml` file. It will tell Wercker which all\nactions, it should perform. Here is my\n[wercker.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yash2696/yash2696.github.io/source/wercker.yml)\nfor reference. In this, I have used two pipelines, _build_ and _deploy_. Please\nfollow the official docs for the more detailed steps. I will list all the\nproblems which I face while setting up things properly.\n\n### Build\n\nFollowing the official guide, I used this\n[step](https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/wercker-step-hugo-build) to trigger Hugo\nto build HTML pages. I had already removed git repository information from the\ntheme folder, so this step finished successfully. If you haven’t, you may add\nthe following piece of code in your build step.\n\n```yml\n- script:\n    name: install git\n    code: |\n        apt-get update\n        apt-get install git -y\n    - script:\n        name: initialize git submodules\n        code: |\n            git submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n### Deploy\n\nThere is no concept named \"Add Deploy Target\" in Wercker as of now. Most of the\non-line tutorials follow this process which is outdated. Now Wercker uses a\nconcept called \"Workflows in Pipelines\".\n\nFor new interface, even if you add a deploy stage in the `wercker.yml`, you will\nhave to create a new pipeline `deploy` under the Workflows tab. After creating\nthe pipeline, the \"YML Pipeline name\" must be set to the deploy stage name,\nwhich in this case is `deploy`.\n\nIn `deploy` stage, I used this\n[step](https://app.wercker.com/applications/55af22c5f32b86a9290ec706/tab/details/)(broken\nlink) to deploy the built site to Github. Each pipeline starts from scratch, so\nfor the deploy pipeline, the git package needs to be installed again. One also\nhas to set up the environment variable `$GIT_TOKEN` to each pipeline, acquired\nfrom Github setting.\n\n![Wercker Pipeline](/images/posts/wercker-pipeline.png \"Wercker Pipeline\")\n\nYou need to generate a new access token for your deploy stage from Github\nsettings.\n![Github Access Token](/images/posts/wercker-access-token.png \"Github Access Token\")\n\nAfter adding the deploy stage, add the token you obtained from the Github to\nEnvironmental Variables in deploy pipeline.\n\n![Wercker Token](/images/posts/wercker-token.png \"Wercker Token\")\n\nOn the next push to your development branch, Wercker will automatically build\nthe site and deploy it on Github Pages.\n",

      "content_html": "\nRecently I was searching for Python projects on Github for contribution. Every\nsingle project I found, had a thing common among them. In every project's\ncontribution guide, it was asked to set up the virtual environment for the\nproject. What the heck is this virtual environment and how does it work?\n\nAs a beginner to open source projects, the problem I faced, in the beginning,\nwas how to set up the development environments for the projects I was looking\nat. I searched the Internet, I found some articles, but they were not complete.\nSo I decided to write this guide, which will be useful for me in future also.\n\nPython uses `pip` for package management.\n\n## Installing pip\n\n`pip` depends on setuptools library, which is in official Ubuntu repositories.\nTo install it for python2 -\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install python-setuptools\n```\n\nThen install `pip` using -\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\n```\n\nand for python3 -\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install python3-setuptools\n```\n\nThen install `pip` using -\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install python3-pip\n```\n\nIt should install `pip` on your system for both python versions. `pip` is very\neasy to use. It will take care of every single package you may require for your\nproject.\n\n### Installing a package using pip\n\n```sh\n# it will search and install [package]\npip install [package]\npip install django\n```\n\nIf you are using python3, then don't forget to use `pip3`.\n\n`pip` can be used to install a specific version of package also.\n\n```sh\n# it will search and install [package] with [version]\npip install [package]==[version]\npip install django==1.6.5\n```\n\n### Uninstalling a package using pip\n\n```sh\n# it will search and uninstall [package]\npip uninstall [package]\npip uninstall django\n```\n\n### upgrading a package using pip\n\n```sh\n# it will upgrade [package] to latest version\npip install --upgrade [package]\npip install --upgrade django\n```\n\n### Creating list of all packages with pip\n\nIt is one of most used and most useful feature of `pip`. It allows you to make a\nlist of all the dependencies of your project.\n\n```sh\n# it will output the file to current directory\npip freeze > [file_name.txt]\n```\n\nAll these commands above will install the packages globally. But that's not what\nis desired. `virtualenv` comes to our rescue here.\n\n## Virtualenv\n\n`virtualenv` solves a very particular problem; it allows multiple python\nprojects that have different and often conflicting dependencies, to coexist on\nthe same system.\n\n`virtualenv` solves this problem by creating different isolated development\nenvironments for your projects. An environment is a folder which contains\neverything; your project needs to work properly.\n\n### Installing virtualenv\n\nBy default, if you install `virtualenv` using `pip`, it will use system's\ndefault python to create virtual environments. To overcome this problem, we will\ninstall `virtualenv` using ubuntu package manager.\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install python-virtualenv\n```\n\n### Installing virtualenvwrapper\n\n`virtualenvwrapper` provides some set of commands which makes working with\nvirtual environments much easier.\n\nTo install it -\n\n```sh\nsudo pip install virtualenvwrapper\n```\n\n`pip`, `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` are the only packages which you will\nneed to install globally. All other per project packages will be installed in\nrespective virtual environments.\n\n`virtualenvwrapper` also places all your virtual environments in one place. It\nmakes working with projects very easy.\n\nNow open your `.bashrc` and add these two lines to the end -\n\n```sh\n# All your projects will be saved in python-dev folder\nexport PROJECT_HOME=~/python-dev\n\n# ~/python-dev/virtualenvs will contains python interpreters for each project.\nexport WORKON_HOME=~/python-dev/virtualenvs\n\n# source the virtualenvwrapper script\nsource /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n```\n\nYou can change `python-dev` to any name you wish. Your virtual environments will\nbe created at that location.\n\nNow restart your terminal to source the `.bashrc` or use -\n\n```sh\nsource .bashrc\n```\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nCreate a virtual environment -\n\n```sh\nmkvirtualenv myproject\n```\n\nIt will create `myproject` folder in the python-dev directory. To activate this\nproject -\n\n```sh\nworkon myproject\n```\n\nAlternatively you can create project using `mkproject` command. It will create a\nvirtual environment as well as a project directory in the `$PROJECT_HOME`, which\nis `cd`-ed into when you `workon` myproject.\n\nDon't forget to deactivate current project when you switch between different\nprojects.\n\nTo deactivate a project -\n\n```sh\ndeactivate\n```\n\nTo delete a virtual environment -\n\n```sh\nrmvirtualenv myproject\n```\n\nList all environments -\n\n```sh\nlsvirtualenv\n```\n\nit will also list all virtual environments -\n\n```sh\nworkon\n```\n\nPlease refer to virtualenvwrapper documentation for\n[full list of virtualenvwrapper commands](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html).\n\nvirtualenvwrapper also provides the tab-completion feature which is very handy\nwhen you have a lot of projects to work with.\n\nThat's it. Hope you liked the post. :smile:\n",

      "content_html": "\nAfter my summer vacation started, I bought a new laptop, and the first thing I\ndid was to install Arch Linux on it. After a standard arch installation\nprocedure, I started putting together my desktop environment, beginning with\nArchLinux and Openbox, and then piecing all pieces together to build a proper\ndesktop environment. Building a desktop this way follows the Unix Methodology;\nhave software that each does one thing well, and when you put them together, you\nget something amazing.\n\nWhen I first installed Arch, I had several choices. I tried `xfce` and `gnome`\nas my desktop environments. While both of them have their pros and cons, I ended\nup liking none. The sole reason was the dependencies; these two software bring\nwith them. My only intention of installing Arch was to have something, which I\ncontrol, not like Ubuntu, where you are forced to use the preinstalled software\nand when you try to uninstall something, you fear of breaking some other\nprogram.\n\nSo I end up going the route of building something up from scratch using Openbox\nas a base. At this point, I have a fast, lightweight desktop that is\nexceptionally stable and is genuinely my desktop as I have built it from the\nground up, choosing every application.\n\n![Openbox on ArchLinux](/images/posts/openbox_desktop.jpg \"Openbox on ArchLinux\")\n\n## Window Manager\n\nAfter the installation of Arch, the first thing I did was to install `openbox`,\na tiling window manager. You may also try other window managers like `awesome`,\n`i3`, and `fluxbox`, etc. but I chose Openbox because it is used everywhere.\nThus there is a plethora of information out there about customizing it.\n\nFor our window manager to show up, it needs to be added either in a login\nmanager or user's `~/.xinitrx` file. There is a default version of this file\nthat contain some code which we may want to retain, so rather than making this\nfile from scratch, copy the default version of the file to the user's home\ndirectory.\n\n```sh\ncp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc\n```\n\nNow add the command `exec Openbox-session` to the end of the file. Remember that\nthe system will ignore the lines following this command. An Openbox session\nshould be able to be started by entering the command `startx`.\n\nAn openbox session can be started automatically upon login using shell's startup\nscript. Add following to the shell's startup script, `~/.bash_profile` for bash\nand `~/.zprofile` for zsh.\n\n```sh\n[[ -z $DISPLAY && $XDG_VTNR -eq 1 ]] && exec startx\n```\n\n## Configuring Openbox\n\nSetting up openbox is quite simple. Four files make the basis of openbox\nconfiguration. They are `rc.xml`, `autostart`, `menu.xml` and `environment`.\nThese files controls everything about the window manager.\n\n- **rc.xml**: Determine the behavior and settings of overall Openbox session\n- **autostart**: Contains a list of applications to be launched with the window\n  manager\n- **menu.xml**: It makes the right-click context menu of the desktop\n- **environment**: Can be used to export and set relevant environmental\n  variables\n\nFor the configuration of Openbox, it is necessary to create a local Openbox\nprofile in the user's home directory. A global configuration file can be found\nin `/etc/xdg/openbox`, which is well documented, and copying the global\nconfiguration to the user's directory will give a good starting point to start\ncustomizing.\n\n```sh\ncp -R /etc/xdg/openbox ~/.config/\n```\n\nThese files can be edited by hand, although some graphical tools are also\navailable, use of these may be desired.\n\n## Themes and Appearance\n\n`obconf` and `lxappearance-obconf` can be used to configure appearance and theme\nof openbox session. There are quite a few themes available in `openbox-themes`\npackage. My personal favorite is `Numix-themes` and\n`Numix-icon-theme-git (AUR)`.\n\nTo see changes after editing a configuration file, the Openbox needs to be\nrefreshed. It can be done with the `reconfigure` command.\n\n```sh\nopenbox --reconfigure\n```\n\n## Menus\n\nThe type and behavior of Openbox menus, accessible by right-clicking the\nbackground, can be changed using `~/.config/openbox/menu.xml` file. Openbox\nprovides two kinds of menus, `Static`, and `Dynamic` menus (Piped and\nGenerators)\n\nStatic menus are hardcoded in XML and is stored in the `menu.xml` file. Whenever\nyou install a new application, you will have to update the XML file to update\nthe menu manually. It is a viable solution if the apps are not installed on a\nday to day basis.\n\nPipe menus are the sections of the Openbox menu that Openbox creates on the fly\nby running a generic script and using its plain text output as menu entries.\nThis scheme can be used in different ways, like adding a mail checker in the\nmenu or adding a weather forecast menu. You can check\n[openbox pipe menu page](http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Pipemenus) for more\ninformation.\n\nGenerators are the most convenient type of menus. These can be found in most\ndesktop environments where applications show up in the menu automatically. If\napplications are being installed regularly, then this will probably be the\npreferred choice.\n\n### Static Menus\n\nThe process of making these menus can be automated by static menu generator like\n`obmenu`. It will generate static menus from installed applications by looking\ninto certain directories. Others available tools are `menumaker`, `obmenu` and\n`xdg-menu`.\n\n### Dynamic Menus\n\nDynamic menus give the same kind of functionality most people are used to. So it\nwas my preferred choice. They can be used to generate full, complex menus on the\nfly. One of the most popular application for generating dynamic menus is\n`obmenu-generator`. Though it is not officially connected to Openbox, it is\nwidely used.\n\nIn order to have `obmenu-generator` make a menu on demand, the `menu.xml` file\nshould contain the following code as the only entry.\n\n```sh\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<openbox_menu>\n    <menu id=\"root-menu\" label=\"OpenBox 3\" execute=\"/usr/bin/obmenu-generator\"></menu>\n</openbox_menu>\n```\n\n## Panels and Taskbars\n\nYou can get any panel like `xfce4-panel` or the simple and customizable `tint2`.\nI chose tint2 because it very closely follows the openbox spirit of having easy\ncustomization with plain configuration files. tint2 package also containg a\ngraphical tool `tint2conf` for customizing panel and you can obviously go right\nto the tint2 configuration file and edit it there. This also means it is easy to\npick up your configuration file and move it to another computer, or restore an\nold configuration since it is as simple as pasting a text document in the right\nplace. tint2 can also have sections for each individual desktop and has various\nsmall widget like programs that can be used with it such as a calendar,\n`gsimplecal`, a volume application, `volumeicon`, a battery indicator,\n`cbatticon`, a network indicator like `wicd` which also have a system tray icon\nand a mini task tray. To start tint2 with openbox, you need to add `tint2 &` to\nthe `autostart` file.\n\n## File Manager\n\nSome file managers deeply integrate into desktop environments, and when\ninstalled with Openbox, they end up pulling multiple dependencies, which is\ncertainly not desired. Our aim behind building an Openbox set up was to have\nminimum dependencies so that we can get a lightweight desktop. However, there\nare several file managers available that fit into the Openbox very well. In my\nchoice, `pcmanfm` is the best choice here. pcmanfm is a lightweight and fast\nfile manager with network and thrash support. pcmanfm can also manage desktop\nicons and wallpaper setting, although if you plan to use conky in your system,\nthen you may not want pcmanfm to manage desktop for you. The reason is that\npcmanfm treats desktop as a window, so when you switch to desktop, the conky\nhides behind the desktop window. To get the icons and wallpaper, you can use\nother standalone tools such as `idesk` and `feh` or `nitrogen`. To start pcmanfm\nis the desktop mode, add the following to the autostart file.\n\n```sh\npcmanfm --desktop &\n```\n\nand to stop it for managing desktop\n\n```sh\npcmanfm --desktop-off &\n```\n\nMany functions present in modern file managers require the installation of a few\nadditional programs. `gvfs` gives you the ability to mount volumes and have\ntrash control. It is not mandatory to have, but it allows on-demand `mounting`\ncompletely from within the file manager, as opposed to having to drop down to\nthe command line. A disk-volume manager such as `udisks2` will also be wanted,\nand for auto-mounting removable disks, `udiskie` works well with Openbox.\nudiskie can be added to Openbox's autostart file like any other application.\n\n## Composition\n\nOpenbox does not provide native support for composition, although having a\ncompositor may prevent screen flickering and other distortion in applications\nlike `oblogout`. Some options work great with Openbox. The one which I am using\nand quite happy with is `compton`. It can be used with or without any initial\nconfiguration, although there are a lot of different configuration options if\nyou decide to customize the setup. To start compton in background with shadows,\nuse this in `autostart` file.\n\n```sh\ncompton -b -c &\n```\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nWhile setting up my desktop using Openbox ended up being much more work than I\ncould have with typical desktop environments. But now I have a much more stable\ndesktop, about which I know, what is running in my system, and that my system is\nnot cluttered with any software that I never use.\n\nWhile it might not be for everybody having to configure every little bit of the\ndesktop, I genuinely feel I have ended up with excellent user experience, and a\nsystem that is customized precisely to fit my needs.\n\n## References\n\n- [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)\n",

Cheers!!!\n\nLet's come to our today's topic on configuring Sublime Text Settings.\n\nThere is just one rule you must follow while designing your own editor\npreference configuration.\n\n> Don't put any lines in your configuration that you don't understand.\n\nYou will find tons of online tutorials that contains all kinds of awesome hacks\nto make your sublime text experience better but the worst way to make your\ndevelopment environment better is just to borrow the configuration from someone\nelse.\n\nSpending your time in actually understand what is happening behind the scenes in\nthe construction of your editor is immensely invaluable. It is similar to the\nincreased information retention that you experience when you copy something from\nthe board.\n\nSo first, take some background of what we are going to do today. I am using\nSublime Text 3 -- dev version, but most of the instructions are similar for\nSublime Text 2 also.\n\nOkay, first open the sublime text, then go to `Preference → Settings → User`.\n\nSo this is your configuration file where you can put all your custom\npreferences. There are other configuration files also, which can be found in\nPreferences.\n\nYou can also find all settings for reference in `Settings → Default` file.\n\nHere is my `Settings → User` file. Feel free to take insiparation from it, and\nmake your sublime text experience unmatchable. I have commented every setting\nwhich is self-understandable.\n\n{/* TODO: {{< gist yashhere dea6728f88865666c20ff1c35e90bd0e >}} */}\n\n## Wrapping It Up\n\nI still stand by my platitude that\n\n> Don't put anything in your configuration file you don't understand!\n\nThat's all for today.

      "content_html": "\nA boy, probably of age 16, just cleared his 10th board exam. He saw people\nworking on computers, and that fascinated him. So he had only one ambition. You\ngot it, right? One fine day, suddenly his friend's mother asked, \"So what about\nthe future? You are going to enter in class 11th. It is the right time to decide\nabout your future. What do you want to become, a doctor or an engineer?\" The boy\nhad no clue how big that question was. What the cost would have been. He simply\nnodded and said, \"I like computers very much so I would go for engineering.\"\n\nThat's it. He decided his fate.\n\nSo here comes the day\n\n## An accident\n\nAfter that day, he got into a coaching institute which promised a good rank in\nJEE. He was told that he would have to study consistently and regularly. The\nboy, being a determined one, started studying day and night.\n\nThis continued for two years. Finally, after giving 12th board exams, he gave\nJEE. Unfortunately, he didn't even get into extended merit list.\n\nDevastated, he pledged not to give up. Oh, that stupid silly guy! He decided to\ntry for one more year.\n\nHe joined another institute in his city. Again the same routine, studying day\nand night to fulfill _his_ dreams.\n\n_Result_: Same, Fail!\n\nBut somehow he got a decent rank in JEE Mains thanks to his excellent\nperformance in board exams.\n\n## A disaster\n\nNow he had to face one more question. Which college and which branch? For him,\nthe answer was simple. Go to any South Indian college thanks to the influence of\nhis cousins on him (who were very successful in their lives, of course!). He\nchose Computer Science and Engineering because\n\n- He loved computers.\n- Everybody said, \"Bahut scope hai is branch me.\"\n- Every top ranker of this country choose this branch.\n\nSo the decision was clear. He packed his bag and left home for a NIT situated\nsome 2200 kms far, the comp-sci branch.\n\n## The coding disaster\n\nHe reached the college. He loved new people, new place, new environment,\neverything was new, right!. Studies started. He got good grades initially until\nthe real coding and Computer Science related stuff started as courses. His\ngrades fell drastically, his morale too. He got good marks enough to pass the\ncourses. He tried giving his best, but all concepts seemed so alien to him as\nthey wouldn't stay inside his head.\n\nThat guy is now about to complete his 2nd year and just thinking what went wrong\nwith him. He is still trying to keep his journey on the right track. Whether he\nwill be able to finish it successfully or not, only time will tell.\n\nAt last one more year is coming, and it's story will also come here next year.\n\n[Inspired by this Quora Post](https://www.quora.com/What-were-you-once-that-youll-never-be-again/answer/Nishant-Kumar-187?srid=8MaF&share=8df79cac)\n",

In distros like Ubuntu,\nit will be opened in nano. Now you will have to find the section where the\ndefaults are listed. Most probably you will find it at the top. Now find the\nline that starts with `Defaults` and append the word `insults` to the end of the\nline (any addition to the line is comma separated). If this line is not present\nthen add the following line to the section\n\n```vim\nDefaults insults\n```\n\n(Always use `visudo` as it has a self-check system which will save you from\nmessing up things)\n\nNow save the file. If you are using vim, then use `Ctrl+X` to save the file and\nquit the editor and if you are using nano then use `Ctrl+X` to leave the editor.\nAt the time of quitting, it will ask you if you want to save the changes.
