        <Section level="h3" title="How I built this site">
          <p>
            I designed and built this website myself. Being a backend developer,
            UI design is not my strongest skill, but playing with latest web
            technologies is an indulgent hobby I don&apos;t want to relinquish.
            The source code of this website is available on{" "}

            , if you&apos;d like to poke around. I started building this version
            of the site in July 2023 and tinker on it regularly.

        <Section level="h3" title="Technologies">
          <p>
            The site is primarily built with Next.js. Most of the site is
            statically rendered at the build time. Vercel takes care of hosting
            this site. Cloudflare manages the DNS.
            <br />
            <br />
            One of my primary intention behind switching to Next.js was to
            explore React. I used React and TailwindCSS to build and design the
            interface. All the notes are written in MDX - a variant of markdown
            that makes it easy to design and reuse custom components and
            interactive JavaScript elements (though I don&apos;t have many
            custom components yet).
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section level="h3" title="Content Editing">
          <p>
            I use MDX files to write content for this site. There is no fancy
            one-click pipeline or a WYSIWYG editor. Whenever I want to create a
            new note, I create a new file and start writing in VSCode. In past,
            I tried to write content in Notion, but that didn&apos;t work after
            a few times. I would definitely like to have a setup where I
            don&apos;t have to worry about git, vscode etc. Given that I
            don&apos;t really need a lot of interactive components in my notes,
            I think this is a doable task. I might do it myself someday.

            Inter is the primary font on this site. I first noticed this being
            used on the{" "}

            of Lee Robinson and instantly loved it. The site deliberately uses a
            single font for both headings and body, to reduce complexity.
