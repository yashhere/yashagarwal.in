          Hi, I am Yash (y-uh-sh) üôè. I&apos;m a software engineer working
          remotely.
        </p>
        <p>
          In tech, I am primarily interested in backend development and learning
          scalable systems.

          I completed my graduation from National Institute of Technology,
          Calicut in 2018. In NITC, I majored in Computer Science and
          Engineering. Apart from curriculam, I was active in managing the{" "}
          <Link href="https://athena.nitc.ac.in/">Software Systems Lab</Link> as
          a system administrator. In 2018, I also led the team organising the
          largest FOSS event in South India at that time - FOSSMeet. Read my
