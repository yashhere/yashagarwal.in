So when you landed on this blog, the first thing you might have noticed is that
the home page of this blog has a Sanskrit shloka. Many people ask me, why did I
choose to display a Sanskrit shloka on my blog.

There is no one answer to this question. There have been several incidents in my
undergraduate life, which have given me a lot of good and evil memories. This
shloka summarizes all those experiences that I earned in NIT Calicut during my
undergraduate course. It reminds me, how I should treat others to receive
similar treatment.

It was my first time away from home and family when I got admission in NIT
Calicut. I was very naive about judging people. I got to know many new people in
NITC. That is when I learned that not everyone is helping you. People are here
to exploit you, and they will do anything to achieve their goals and to get
success, whether it comes at the price of someone else's loss. It is the harsh
truth of life, and the sooner one understands this, the better. I realized this
in my second year, and that is when my life changed. Thankfully, I did not find
other such people after my first year. However, life is very long, and I am
bound to find such people at some point in my life again. I hope the experience
that I earned in NITC will help me face that time.

Now, to the second part of the question, why Sanskrit? A quick Google search
reveals that this shloka represents the concept of
[Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule), which is common to
most world religions, and Hinduism is no exception here. There is even a
[question](https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/21431/what-all-hindu-scriptures-advocate-the-golden-rule-and-what-is-the-oldest-hindu)
about the relation of this shloka with Hinduism. I studied Sanskrit for six
years till my 10<sup>th</sup> standard and feel a connection to it. Besides,
Hindi is my mother tongue, so Sanskrit was the obvious choice given that there
is not much Hinduism related literature available in Hindi.

**Edit(23/03/2018)**: I have removed the shloka from the front page now. I am
keeping this post for historical purpose.
