I bought a new domain a few days back - _yashagarwal.in_. I was trying to buy
this domain for the last two years, but it was already taken. My previous
domain, _yashagarwal.me_ that I got for free via GitHub education pack, was good
enough for me, but the thought that I own a domain which is a top-level domain
of some other country was in itself something which was not comfortable to me.
So when I got the chance to buy this domain, I didn't delay. Hope this domain
will remain my personal home on the web for years to come.

The domain is mapped with GitLab, and the SSL certificates are provided by
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Let's Encrypt requires you to renew
the SSL certificates every 90 days. That seems like a manual work to me.
Moreover, my new registrar, GoDaddy, provides a complete API for their domain
services. So I am planning to write a script that utilizes the APIs of
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/help/api/README.md) and
[GoDaddy](https://developer.godaddy.com/) to deploy the SSL certificates
automatically. I will probably use the DNS based authentication to verify the
ownership of my domain, as that seems the only method that does not require any
modification on the host side. I will write a post with all the details about
the script, once I finish implementing it.

That's all for this post. See you next time. :)
