Recently I was searching for Python projects on Github for contribution. Every
single project I found, had a thing common among them. In every project's
contribution guide, it was asked to set up the virtual environment for the
project. What the heck is this virtual environment and how does it work?

As a beginner to open source projects, the problem I faced, in the beginning,
was how to set up the development environments for the projects I was looking
at. I searched the Internet, I found some articles, but they were not complete.
So I decided to write this guide, which will be useful for me in future also.

Python uses `pip` for package management.

# Installing pip

`pip` depends on setuptools library, which is in official Ubuntu repositories.
To install it for python2 -

```sh
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
```

Then install `pip` using -

```sh
sudo apt-get install python-pip
```

and for python3 -

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
```

Then install `pip` using -

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

It should install `pip` on your system for both python versions. `pip` is very
easy to use. It will take care of every single package you may require for your
project.

## Installing a package using pip

```sh
# it will search and install [package]
pip install [package]
pip install django
```

If you are using python3, then don't forget to use `pip3`.

`pip` can be used to install a specific version of package also.

```sh
# it will search and install [package] with [version]
pip install [package]==[version]
pip install django==1.6.5
```

## Uninstalling a package using pip

```sh
# it will search and uninstall [package]
pip uninstall [package]
pip uninstall django
```

## upgrading a package using pip

```sh
# it will upgrade [package] to latest version
pip install --upgrade [package]
pip install --upgrade django
```

## Creating list of all packages with pip

It is one of most used and most useful feature of `pip`. It allows you to make a
list of all the dependencies of your project.

```sh
# it will output the file to current directory
pip freeze > [file_name.txt]
```

All these commands above will install the packages globally. But that's not what
is desired. `virtualenv` comes to our rescue here.

# Virtualenv

`virtualenv` solves a very particular problem; it allows multiple python
projects that have different and often conflicting dependencies, to coexist on
the same system.

`virtualenv` solves this problem by creating different isolated development
environments for your projects. An environment is a folder which contains
everything; your project needs to work properly.

## Installing virtualenv

By default, if you install `virtualenv` using `pip`, it will use system's
default python to create virtual environments. To overcome this problem, we will
install `virtualenv` using ubuntu package manager.

```sh
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
```

## Installing virtualenvwrapper

`virtualenvwrapper` provides some set of commands which makes working with
virtual environments much easier.

To install it -

```sh
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
```

`pip`, `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` are the only packages which you will
need to install globally. All other per project packages will be installed in
respective virtual environments.

`virtualenvwrapper` also places all your virtual environments in one place. It
makes working with projects very easy.

Now open your `.bashrc` and add these two lines to the end -

```sh
# All your projects will be saved in python-dev folder
export PROJECT_HOME=~/python-dev

# ~/python-dev/virtualenvs will contains python interpreters for each project.
export WORKON_HOME=~/python-dev/virtualenvs

# source the virtualenvwrapper script
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

You can change `python-dev` to any name you wish. Your virtual environments will
be created at that location.

Now restart your terminal to source the `.bashrc` or use -

```sh
source .bashrc
```

## Basic Usage

Create a virtual environment -

```sh
mkvirtualenv myproject
```

It will create `myproject` folder in the python-dev directory. To activate this
project -

```sh
workon myproject
```

Alternatively you can create project using `mkproject` command. It will create a
virtual environment as well as a project directory in the `$PROJECT_HOME`, which
is `cd`-ed into when you `workon` myproject.

Don't forget to deactivate current project when you switch between different
projects.

To deactivate a project -

```sh
deactivate
```

To delete a virtual environment -

```sh
rmvirtualenv myproject
```

List all environments -

```sh
lsvirtualenv
```

it will also list all virtual environments -

```sh
workon
```

Please refer to virtualenvwrapper documentation for
[full list of virtualenvwrapper commands](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html).

virtualenvwrapper also provides the tab-completion feature which is very handy
when you have a lot of projects to work with.

That's it. Hope you liked the post. ðŸ˜„
