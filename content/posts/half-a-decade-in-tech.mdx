I completed five years in the tech industry on August 1. I started out as a fresher straight out of college. I had noÂ [idea](/blog/beginning-a-new-journey)Â how the journey would turn out to be. I have sailed smoothly through the last five years by God's grace. Although I sometimes feel left behind compared to my peers in career growth, my personal metrics of personal development have been mainly on the positive side (worth mentioning that I have evolved the way I look at personal growth as well.)

Often, I struggled with the feeling that I was not fit for this industry. My peers are doing great in their roles, achieving promotions year after year, running side gigs, moving to the US, earning in dollars, and getting exposure to the Bay Area. I felt like missing out on everything great in life. Whenever I open Instagram or LinkedIn, I see people enjoying their lives to the fullest. Of course, I know that what I see may not be the reality. Still, perhaps because of the highly competitive environment the Indian kids are up-brought in, I couldn't help but doubt my capabilities.

That's how life plays out. Some days are bright and sunny. You feel like that king who can't do anything wrong on these days. On the other hand, there are gloomy days when you wake up doubting yourself. Nothing goes your way. You feel pathetic, and helplessness clouds your judgement. It is these days when you will find the realÂ *you*. How you handle these days will make or break you. Alas, this is life, and we must obey its rules.

I have become a different person from what I was five years ago. The industry has moulded me in a different shape now. I am more confident, concentrated and mature. I am rediscovering the missing criticality in my thought process. I have learnt to be satisfied running theÂ *race*Â at my own pace. I am working slowly but steadily on my future. And I am proud to claim that I am better mentally and physically than five years ago. I believe this is the most appropriate criterion to determine my success.

# Coding is the easiest

When I was in college, coding felt like the most challenging task. I was afraid that I will be able to manage the expectations of my future teams. Turns out, I was wrong. Writing code is easy, maintaining it is harder and convincing people the hardest.

Maintaining the code takes a lot of effort and patience if not done correctly right from the commit. Customer demands and internal requirements change over time. Your team changed its size and shape, and the persons who wrote that library are no longer with the company. With proper documentation and UTs, it gets easier for newcomers to take ownership without an upfront investment of significant human hours. Unfortunately, this is not how it works in most tech teams, and the only way to get the work done is to get your hands dirty with code.

> One of the best compliments I received from my manager is that with my commits, QA doesnâ€™t have to worry much about validations because I already added so many testing details in my PR descriptions. In fact, in my last 1.5 years at Netskope, I have been responsible for only two regressions - the first happened in my first week at the company and another a year later because I was unaware of that particular code path.

People are the toughest. Early in my career, I used to try to convince my seniors at face value without any research. Boy, I was so full of confidence back then. Over time, I learnt that it is easier to convince people with data. Throw authentic data at them and then start talking. They will listen. The seniors, who I thought were the hurdles in my way, were just trying to do their jobs. I have grown strong empathy for my management in these years. As a result, I find it easy to talk with them after I have done my due diligence and collected enough data to support my propositions. Unlike code, people are different from one another, and each has their own way of working. The faster one adopts, the faster one grows.

# If you donâ€™t ask, you donâ€™t get

In a typical tech team at a reputable company, everybody is a top talent. Everybody wants to reach the next level; hence the competition is steep. When everybody is trying their best to achieve that next promotion, it is difficult to get it without non-work effort. That is where the skills of negotiation come in handy. My feeling of FOMO comes from the fact that I never sought any kind of promotion or pay raise at work. I always trusted my managers to do the heavy lifting, which never worked. If I didnâ€™t ask for anything, it doesnâ€™t mean nobody else did too. And the managers will prefer those performing at my level and have also explicitly requested promotion.

I have been trying to change this for the last few months. Being vocal about your work is a necessity to reach the next level.

# Customer First

Businesses need to generate a profit. No matter how world-class your product is, whether you use cutting-edge tech in developing your products, customers donâ€™t care. They donâ€™t care if I am following all the best practices in the world. They only care about getting their work done; if my product is not helping, it is useless for them.

For a business, the latest and greatest doesnâ€™t matter as much as getting the shit done. If you canâ€™t deliver on time, you will lose the race. Customers love quality but also want to see things working as quickly as possible. It is not that your work is over once the product is shipped. After deployment, subsequent support is equally important. There are SLAs to honour, bugs to be fixed, and those weird customer requirements you couldnâ€™t guess during that first architecture design meetings. Things happen, things go wrong, and you must fix these to win that new contract next year.

# Work life balance comes with a cost

I have been fortunate to have an excellent work-life balance in the last five years. Rarely I had to work on weekends. Work gets spilled to after-work-hours at least once every few weeks. However, I have not utilised my free time to its fullest. If I had used my time correctly, I couldâ€™ve learnt a lot of new stuff (hobbies and work-related). My focus in the last five years has been on various things, and learning new tech was the least important. It is only last few months that I have started to learn stuff again, perhaps because I have realised that I need to prepare myself for the next-level transition. You will notice a change in the activity on this blog as well.

On-calls are another aspect of a tech job. I got introduced to it at Netskope, where every developer has to be on-call for one week continuously once every two-three months. Being on-call comes with a specific stress level. Still, it is a great learning opportunity to get to know the product from a critical standpoint. Although I donâ€™t enjoy it very much, it is part and parcel of the job so I canâ€™t ignore it either.

# Remote work is the future but â€¦

Since the pandemic, remote work has picked up pace. I have been working remotely for the last three years, and while I enjoy it, I am concerned about my career growth. Looking at the state of big tech, I am uncertain how long the rest of the industry will be willing to continue with remote work. On the other hand, due to the rigidity and resistance shown by the big tech towards remote work, there may be a significant drift of talent towards more-remote friendly companies.

Remote work suits well to some like me, who are appalled by the pathetic state of infrastructure and quality of life of the Indian tech cities. Unless the state of affairs in these cities improves, I find it difficult to even think of moving back. However, having a job is the prime concern, and if this is attacked, I might find myself compelled to move back. But until then, Jaipur is the best.

There is still a long journey left for me in the industry. Five years in tech is like a lifetime. It sometimes becomes challenging to keep up with the rapid changes in the tech world. With the advent of AI, it may become even more difficult for knowledge workers to stay relevant. Instead of running behind every latest framework, sticking to the basics may be a good idea. Frameworks may come and go, but basics will always stay in fashion.

Hoping to be at my best in the years to come **ðŸ¥³**
