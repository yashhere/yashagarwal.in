I completed five years in tech industry on August 1. Although I sometimes feel left behind in comparison to my peers in career growth, I am content with the way the journey has been. Many times, I felt that I am not fit for this industry. People are doing great in their roles, achieving promotions year after year, running side-gigs, moving to US, earning in dollars, getting exposure to the Bay Area. I felt missing out.

Every time I open Instagram or LinkedIn, I see people enjoying their lives to the fullest. Of course I know that what I see may not be the reality, but perhaps it is because of the highly competitive environment that the Indians kids are up-brought in, I couldn’t help but doubt my capabilities. I think that’s how the life plays out. Some days are bright and sunny. On these days, you feel like that king who can’t do anything wrong. On the other hand, there are gloomy days, where you wake up doubting yourself. Nothing goes your way. You feel pathetic and helplessness clouds your judgement. It is these days when the you will find the real *you*. How you handle these days will make or break you.

Alas, this is life and I have to play by its rules. The last years have been extremely fulfilling at times and equally stressful at others.

I have become a different person from what I was five years ago. Industry has moulded me in a different shape now.

# Coding is the easiest

When I was in college, coding felt the most difficult task. I was afraid if I will be able to manage the expectations of my future teams. Turns out, I was wrong. Writing code is easy, maintaining it is harder and convincing people, the hardest.

Maintaining the code takes a lot of efforts and patience if not done correctly right from the commit. Customer demands and internal requirements change over time. Your team changes its size and shape and the persons who wrote that library are no longer with the company. Without proper documentation and UTs, it gets hard for newcomers to take the ownership without upfront investment of significant number of human-hours. Unfortunately this is the reality of most tech teams and the only way to get the work done is to get your hands dirty with code.

> One of best compliments I received from my manager is that with my commits, QA don’t have to worry much about validations because I already add so much testing details in my PR descriptions. In fact, in my last 1.5 year at Netskope, I have been responsible for only two regressions - first happened in my first week at company and another a year later because I was not aware of that particular code path.

People are the toughest. Early in my career, I used to try to convince my seniors on face value, without any research. Boy, I was so full of confidence, back then. Over time, I learnt that it is easier to convince people with data. Throw authentic data at them and then start talking. They will listen. The seniors who I thought are the hurdles in my way, were just trying to do their jobs. I have grown strong empathy for my management in these years and as a result, I find it easy to talk with them after I have done my due diligence and collected enough data to support my propositions. Unlike code, people are different from one another and each have their own way of working. The faster one adopts, the faster one grows.

# If you don’t ask, you don’t get

In a typical tech team at a reputable company, every body is a top talent in their own. Everybody wants to reach to the next level hence the competition is steep. When everybody is trying their best to achieve that next promotion, it is difficult to get it without any non-work effort. In my opinion, that is where the skills of negotiation comes handy. My feeling of FOMO comes from the fact that I never sought any kind of promotion or pay raise at work. I always trusted my managers to do the heavy lifting for me, which never worked. If I didn’t ask for anything, doesn’t mean nobody else did too. And the managers will prefer those who are performing at my level and have also asked explicitly for promotion.

I am trying to change this for last few months. Being vocal about your work is a necessity to reach the next level.

# Customer First

Businesses need to generate a profit. No matter how world class your product is, whether you use cutting-edge tech in developing your products, customers don’t care. They don’t care if I am following all the best practices in the world. All they care is getting their work done and if my product is not helping, it is useless for them.

For a business, the latest and greatest don’t matter as much as getting the shit done. If you can’t deliver on time, you are bound to loose the race. Customers love quality but they also want to see things working as quickly as possible. It is not that your work is over once the product is shipped. After deployment support is equally important. There are SLAs to honour, there are bugs to be fixed, there are those weird customer requirements which you couldn’t guess during that first architecture design meetings. Things happen, things go wrong and you have to fix them to win that new contract next year.

# Work life balance comes with a cost

I have been fortunate enough to get a good work life balance in last five years. Rarely, I had to work on weekends. Work gets spilled to after-work-hours, at least once every few weeks. However, I have not utilised the free time to its fullest. If I had utilised my time properly, I could’ve learnt a lot of new stuff (both hobby and related to work). My focus in last five years has been on a variety of things, learning new tech was the least important of them. It is only last few months, that I have started to learn stuff again, perhaps because I have realised that I need to prepare myself for next-level transition. You will notice a change in the activity on this blog as well.

On-calls are another aspect of a tech job. I got introduced to it at Netskope, where every developer has to be on on-call for one week continuously for one week once every two-three months. Being on on-call comes with a certain level of stress but it is a great learning opportunity to get to know the product from a critical standpoint. Although I don’t enjoy it very much, it is part and parcel of the job so can’t ignore it either.

# Remote work is the future but …

Since the pandemic, remote work has picked up pace. I have been working remotely for last three years and while I enjoy it, I am somewhat concerned about my career growth because of this. Looking at the state of big tech, it is uncertain for how long the rest of the industry will be willing to continue with the remote work. On the other hand, due to the rigidity and resistance shown by the big tech towards remote work, there may be a great drift of talent towards more-remote friendly companies.

Remote work suits well to some like me who are appalled by the pathetic state of infrastructure and quality of life of the Indian tech cities. Unless the state of affairs in these cities improve, I find it difficult to even think of moving back. However, having a job is the prime concern and this is attacked, I might find myself compelled to move back. But until then, Jaipur is the best.
