This article will show how to add estimated reading time to your posts. This is pretty easy to achieve with Contentlayer’s computed fields.

This article assumes that you have read my [previous post](/blog/integrating-contentlayer-with-nextjs-blog) and integrated Contentlayer into your project accordingly. We will build upon the foundations laid in the last article and add a new computed field to the `Post` document type to display the estimated reading time of the article to the readers.

# How to compute reading time?

Computing the reading time of any text content requires two things -

1. The text content itself, which, thanks to Contentlayer, is available to us in raw form in `post.body.raw` where `post` is the JSON parsed by `contentlayer` from the `mdx` file.
2. An algorithm to calculate the reading time

We can come up with our own [algorithm](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-more-accurately-estimate-read-time-for-medium-articles-in-javascript-fb563ff0282a/) or use a package to do the heavy lifting for us. A number of packages exist on the NPM registry to help with this task -

1. [reading-time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reading-time)
2. [read-time-estimate](https://github.com/pritishvaidya/read-time-estimate)

`read-time-estimate` appears to be a more complete package also taking image read times into consideration, but I am not sure if it is meant as a ready-to-use package. At least I couldn’t get it to work with my setup. So, I decided to go with `reading-time`, a far more popular and supported package.

# Adding a new computed field

After finalising the package to use, it’s time to install it. I use `yarn`, so I will use it to install the package. You can find a similar command for your package manager.

```bash
yarn add -D reading-time
```

This will install `reading-time` as a dev-dependency in our project, which is acceptable given that we will only be utilising this package at build time.

Once installed, it is time to import and use it in the `contentlayer.config.js` -

```jsx showLineNumbers {2, 23-26}
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from "contentlayer/source-files"
import readingTime from "reading-time"

const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Post",
  filePathPattern: "posts/*.mdx",
  contentType: "mdx",
  fields: {
    title: { type: "string", required: true },
    published: { type: "string", required: true },
    description: { type: "string" },
    status: {
      type: "enum",
      options: ["draft", "published"],
      required: true,
    },
  },
  computedFields: {
    slug: {
      type: "string",
      resolve: (doc) => doc._raw.sourceFileName.replace(/\.mdx$/, ""),
    },
    readingTime: {
      type: "json",
      resolve: (doc) => readingTime(doc.body.raw),
    },
  },
}))

export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: "content",
  documentTypes: [Post],
})
```

# Rendering it

In the generated JSON files, we will have the `readingTime` property available for use in the components.

```json showLineNumbers {17-22}
{
  "title": "Hello World",
  "published": "2023-07-30T13:05:24.000Z",
  "status": "published",
  "body": {
    "raw": "\nHello world! This is my first post.\n",
    "code": "var Component=(()=>{var sr=Object.create;..."
  },
  "_id": "posts/hello-world.mdx",
  "_raw": {
    "sourceFilePath": "posts/hello-world.mdx",
    "sourceFileName": "hello-world.mdx",
    "sourceFileDir": "posts",
    "contentType": "mdx",
    "flattenedPath": "posts/hello-world"
  },
  "readingTime": {
    "text": "1 min read",
    "minutes": 0.035,
    "time": 2100,
    "words": 7
  },
  "type": "Post",
  "slug": "hello-world"
}
```

To use it in the component, we can use the `post.readingTime.minutes` property to show the time-to-read, something like this (where `post` contains the JSON data shown above) -

```html
<p>
  Time to read: {Math.round(post.readingTime.minutes)} mins
</p>
```
