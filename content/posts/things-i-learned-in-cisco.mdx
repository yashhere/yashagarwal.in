After three years at Cisco, I finally decided to explore other opportunities
in 2021. 22/01/2022 was my last day in Cisco. It has been an exhilarating
journey. Even more so because it was my first such journey. I thoroughly enjoyed
my time at Cisco, both professionally and personally.

Cisco provided me ample chances to work on a variety of problems. I started in a
totally independent role exploring various open-source products and developing
POCs integrating multiple open-source tools to the Cisco product line. I worked
with OPA, ModSecurity, OpenRASP, etc. along with evaluation of Signal Sciences,
K2 etc. We also worked on identifying differences between Snort's http module
and ModSecurity, apart from developing POCs to identify supply chain attacks by
evaluating the build artefacts generated in a CI pipeline.

Later I got a chance to work with a typical product development team when I
switched to Snort team where I worked on the FTD integration for Snort, and
helped in shipping high-quality code enhancing legacy Cisco firewalls. I also
got an opportunity to contribute to some significant components to the very
early stage Secure Firewall Cloud Native (SFCN) – Cisco's own cloud-based
security solution – where I introduced an important component required for
health monitoring in the SFCN clusters. Throughout my tenure at Cisco, I got
opportunities to work on both the legacy (Lina ASA - a 20-year-old product) and
the latest tools and technologies – Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Prometheus
etc.

But, work was not the best thing about Cisco. The work was, of course,
excellent, but what makes Cisco a dream company for many is its people. The
culture that Cisco imbibes is pure gold. I don't know how the rest of the
industry operates in this department, simply because of my inexperience. But for
a novice like me, Cisco provided an ideal launchpad. I have many regrets about
my time at Cisco, more on this later in the post. The people I met and worked
with throughout my time in Cisco were exceptional in their work and, at the same
time, were quite humble and down to earth in their dealings with me. I have also
heard about some bad experiences from people working in Cisco, so I may have
been fortunate in this aspect. Exceptions are everywhere, but they should not be
the norm. And the toxicity is definitely not the norm in Cisco.

While I learned a lot of things in Cisco, there were a lot of opportunities that
I didn't utilize while in Cisco. There used to be many hackathons, patentothons,
cultural, literary, technical clubs, and sporting facilities in Cisco. Many of
my friends were part of these activities, and some even led the organizing teams
of these event. I never tried to contribute to any of these events. I had some
personal and professional reasons behind this lack of enthusiasm. One of my
colleagues criticized me **privately** for this on my last day - "Yash, I wish
you had shown more involvement during the team building activities." I have been
an introvert throughout my life, and changing one's personality is not easy. But
this is something I will actively try to avoid repeating.

Now, you may ask, if everything was so rosy about Cisco, why did you leave,
Yash?

Well, the reasons are many folded -

1. I am only 25. It is not a time to settle for me.
2. I was trying to break away from the traditional network security domain. I
   have been interested in distributed systems and cloud security. Still, my
   current team was not an ideal place for this. Switching to some other team
   inside Cisco was an option. But I decided to explore the industry from
   another perspective by changing the company.
3. Few more reasons that are not as important to mention here.

Anyway, Cisco will always have a special place in my heart for introducing me to
the corporate world.

It is farewell for now. Au Revoir, Cisco!
