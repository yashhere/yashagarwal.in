I have been using Linux since I was in my second year of undergraduate. My experiments with the dotfiles (configuration files) also started at the same time. For the uninformed, in Linux, it is common to configure a lot of settings and configurations within dotfiles. Dotfiles are files in a Linux user's home directory that begin with a dot or a full-stop character. This dot indicates to the operating system that these files are used to store the settings of programs like `vim` or shells like `bash` or `fish` to name a few.

In the beginning, I was keeping a manual backup of my dotfiles by copying them to a folder from time to time. But the list soon started getting huge, that it became complicated for me to keep track of the changes. Then I moved to symlinks. I started symlinking all the dotfiles from my folder to their usual locations. This setup worked perfectly fine, but as my collection of dotfiles grew, It became very cumbersome for me to symlink every dotfile manually.

I also tried a few tools built for this particular purpose. Some of them are `vcsh`, `mr`, and `stow`. These tools work just fine, but I was not willing to learn new tools just for maintaining my dotfiles. At last, I decided to write my tool to solve this problem. This way, there will not be any external dependency, and this tool will also become part of my dotfiles.

## Design

The tool, in itself, is inspired by the [UNIX tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file#UNIX/Linux) of keeping configuration files for the settings of the programs. This configuration system uses a JSON formatted dotfile.

[Here](https://github.com/yashhere/ConMan) is the source code for the configuration system. Let's have a look at the file structure of the repository.

```sh
|-- .backups
|   |-- 08-01-2018-15:47
|   |-- 08-01-2018-19:30
|   |-- ......
|-- configure.py
|-- current_status
|-- dotfiles
|   |-- dunst
|   |-- gtk-3.0
|   |-- i3
|   |-- ......
|-- dotfiles.json
|-- LICENSE
`-- README.md
```

During the initial setup, you need to edit the `dotfiles.json` file to suit your setup. A relevant section of the JSON file is given below.

```json
{
  "pre": [
    {
      "name": "cloning repository",
      "command": "git",
      "subcommand": "clone",
      "argument": "https://github.com/yashhere/dotfiles.git"
    }
  ],
  "linking": [
    {
      "name": "bashrc",
      "src": "dotfiles/.bashrc",
      "dest": ".bashrc"
    },
    {
      "name": "bash_profile",
      "src": "dotfiles/.bash_profile",
      "dest": ".bash_profile"
    },
    {
      "name": "profile",
      "src": "dotfiles/.profile",
      "dest": ".profile"
    },
    {
      "name": "i3",
      "src": "dotfiles/i3",
      "dest": ".config/i3"
    }
  ]
}
```

As can be seen, the JSON file has an array variable `linking`, which can be used to set the paths for each configuration file and folder. The `configure.py` script also requires a `dotfiles` folder to be present in the current directory. The folder can be created manually, or if it is already version controlled on GitHub, then the script can clone it. For that, you can edit the `pre` section in the `dotfiles.json`.

Your dotfiles and config folders go inside the `dotfiles` folder. You need to copy all your current configurations to this folder to get started.

So, how does the script know where a file or folder will be linked? Simple, you need to edit the `dotfiles.json` file and add source and destination locations. For example, if you want to set up configurations of `i3` to its original location (which is, `$HOME/.config/i3`), then you need to create a new JSON object in the `linking` array, like this.

```json
{
  "name": "i3",
  "src": "dotfiles/i3",
  "dest": ".config/i3"
}
```

Here the `name` is used to identify the configuration file, the `src` parameter is the location of your config file/folder in the dotfiles directory, and the `dest` parameter is the final destination of the file/folder. Keen observers would notice that I have not used `$HOME` anywhere. It is understood that the configuration will go to the current user's home directory. So the `dest` is relative to the user's home directory, and `src` is relative to the directory from which the `configure.py` script is executed.

And you are done! Now, run `configure.py`, and all your dotfiles and folders will be symlinked to their correct place.

The `current_status` file saves all the symlink locations that are being managed by the script, for your easy reference and to debug any error.

## Behind the Scenes

A lot to cool things happen behind the scenes. The script will check if any previous symlink exists at the given `dest` location. It removes any symlinks to avoid redundancy. If the dest already has any dotfile or folder, then it backs it up in the `.backups` under today's date and time before replacing it with a symlink to avoid any potential data loss.

I hope the article was useful. Cheers :smile:
