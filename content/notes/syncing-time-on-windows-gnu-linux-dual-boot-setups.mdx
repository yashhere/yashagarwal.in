This post is going to be one of those that I have written for my reference.
Whatever I am going to mention in this post is not new. Everything has already
been said and written many times on many websites and Linux forums.

So I will start by explaining the problem. When you try to dual boot your
machine to run both GNU/Linux and Windows operating systems, you might have
noticed that the time is not the same in both the operating systems. It is
generally one operating system showing the correct time, and the other one
showing the wrong time. It happens because Microsoft Windows thinks that the
hardware clock (CMOS clock or BIOS clock) of the machine is using the local time
(depends on your current time zone), and hence it doesn't do anything and shows
you the same time. But most GNU/Linux operating systems (Ubuntu, Arch Linux,
etc.) think that the hardware clock is set to track UTC. Hence the mismatch in
the time happens. For example, assume that the current real-time is 10:22:51,
and the hardware clock time is set to 10:22:51. Windows will interpret this time
as local time and show 10:22:51, but Linux based systems will show 15:52:51
because they will understand this time as UTC. Of course, the above example is
true if we assume time zone as India, which is +05:30 from UTC.

This issue can be fixed either from Windows or from GNU/Linux OS. I prefer to
adjust the behavior of Windows to use UTC. It is much more convenient to use
when traveling between different time zones. Please note that this method might
not work or cause instability with older versions of Windows OS. I have tried
this fix on Windows 10, and it works without any issues.

Open an Administrator Command Prompt by pressing `âŠž + x`, then type `a`. This
method of opening the Administrator Command Prompt does not work on Windows 7.

Now execute the following command:

```bash
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation" /v RealTimeIsUniversal /d 1 /t REG_DWORD /f
```

Windows Time Service, which keeps the clock in Windows OS accurate, will still
write the local time to the Real-time clock (RTC) regardless of the registry
settings on shutdown. So I prefer to disable the Windows Time Service.

```bash
sc config w32time start= disabled
```

Now you may need to change the time in your BIOS to UTC time, although that
depends on whether your Windows OS was showing the correct time before applying
the above modifications. If yes, then changing BIOS time to UTC will make sure
that both Windows and GNU/Linux convert hardware clock to local time.
