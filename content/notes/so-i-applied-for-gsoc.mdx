I first heard about Google Summer of Code (GSoC) in my second year (2016). It
was quite fascinating to know that such a program exists (possibly because of
that super attractive amount of money, $5500 at that time). I researched about
it and sent emails to some mentors. The replies were mostly encouraging, but I
still could not gather the courage to apply as I used to doubt my capabilities.
Then last year (2017) again, I decided that I should try for GSoC one more time.
I looked for the projects, started reading codebase of one project, but due to
my lack of determination, I again did not apply.

In the summers of 2017, I got some time to think about it. I decided that for
the next year, I will try everything to make sure that I apply for GSoC 2018. I
started coding as much as possible and pushing my code to GitHub to build an
impressive profile.

Now I can say that I am satisfied with my efforts to some extent. I did start
some good [open](https://github.com/yashhere/BeautifyMP3)
[source](https://github.com/yashhere/ConMan)
[projects](https://github.com/yashhere/Goofy). They are not very extraordinary,
but something is better than nothing. I dived into Debian packaging also and
volunteered for a FOSS event. Spreading awareness about FOSS is also
contributing to FOSS. Isn't it?

Coming back to GSoC, this year, I have successfully submitted a proposal to the
Debian Project. It does not matter whether I get it or not. I overcame one of my
biggest fears of doubting my capabilities. It is something that I was trying to
do for the last two years. This moment is worth celebrating.

Read about my GSoC project on
[Boot Many Machines via Bittorrent](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2018/Projects#SummerOfCode2018.2FProjects.2FBootTorrent.Boot_many_machines_via_bittorrent).
It is related to something which I learned in [SSL](http://athena.nitc.ac.in/)
as SSL admin.

Eagerly waiting for the results. 😄

**Update(24/04/2018)**: Finally, I did not get into GSoC this time too. No
worries. I anticipated the results and prepared backup plans. Looking forward to
a productive summer. :)
