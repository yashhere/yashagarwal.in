Recently, I got a chance to set up ALM Octane on one of my university servers
for a course project. From the support page of ALM Octane:

# Precursor

My [department](http://cse.nitc.ac.in/) insists on using open-source software (a
plus point, indeed!). But ALM Octane has Oracle DB/MSSQL as a dependency. My
professor was not very enthusiastic about installing a proprietary database on
the server. So I came up with a different approach. I set up this database
([free version](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/xe.html) of
Oracle DB, the Oracle Database 11g Express Edition) in a Docker container. ALM
Octane has three components -- Oracle DB, Elastic Search, and the Octane Server
itself. The problem was to handle the condition that these three components
should be installed on different machines. I decided to use three separate
Docker containers for this isolation and then configured them to communicate
with each other with docker-compose.

## Wait ... Docker Compose?

(Skip this if already know about Docker and Compose)

> Docker-compose is a tool to define and run multi-container Docker
> applications. Compose uses a compose file to configure the services used by
> the applications. Then all the services and the application can be run by
> using a single command.

So before reading this article any further, if you do not know about
docker-compose, go and read about it.

# The Problem

Three primary services are required for the proper functioning of the Octane
Server -- Octane, Oracle DB and Elastic Search. The difficulty was to set up
adequate configuration options for these services and the appropriate setup for
communication between them. I searched on Docker Hub for any pre-built images.
Fortunately, I found some pre-built Docker images for my purpose. So I started
writing my config file.

# The Solution

Here is my config file for easy reference.

```yaml
version: "2"
services:
  octane_oracle:
    image: alexeiled/docker-oracle-xe-11g
    shm_size: 2g
    mem_limit: 4g
  octane_es:
    image: elasticsearch:2.4
    environment:
      - ES_HEAP_SIZE=4G
    mem_limit: 4g
  octane:
    image: hpsoftware/almoctane
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - /opt/octane/conf:/opt/octane/conf
      - /opt/octane/log:/opt/octane/log
      - /opt/octane/repo:/opt/octane/repo
    links:
      - octane_oracle
      - octane_es
    mem_limit: 4g
    env_file:
      - ./octane.env
```

The configuration options in the code are for a system with RAM of 8GB. The
options must be tuned for the best performance before deploying on the
production server.

In the code, I have exposed port `8080` of the Octane Docker container to the
port 8080 of the host machine. It will make sure that we can access the Octane
application on `localhost:8080`. The `octane.env` file contains three variables
for easy site management.

```bash
SERVER_DOMAIN="your domain name"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="your password"
#This disables the minimum memory check to enable to run on smaller machines.
DISABLE_VALIDATOR_MEMORY=true
```

Now, if you try to run the container with `docker-compose up`, you will
encounter various validation errors. It is because, before starting the server,
you need to adjust some settings. If you noticed in the config file, there is a
section to define volumes. These volumes are persistent and are used to keep
changes saved between two docker-compose runs. I have mapped three volumes from
the Docker container to the host machine. So you can now edit the files in the
`/opt/octane/` folder on the host machine, and changes will reflect in the
Docker container. The file where you will have to make changes is
`/opt/octane/conf/setup.xml`.

You can read the documentation of ALM Octane to find out which settings to be
changed. Once you do the necessary changes, fire up the command
`docker-compose up` and wait for some time. Docker Compose will finish
processing, and the server can be accessed on `http://localhost:8080` on the
host machine. While deploying it on the production server, make sure that your
network administrator has opened the port 8080 for your server. Otherwise, the
site will not be accessible. Also, the docker-compose can be run in the
background by issuing command `docker-compose up -d`.
