Yesterday I installed Arch Linux once again. A clean, bloat-free desktop with
Budgie Desktop environment with some must-have open source tools. Everything
worked fine except WiFi and some minor bugs in Budgie(I don't know whether it is
a bug in Budgie or just a wrong setting). I also faced the problem of mounting
Windows NTFS volumes on the user's wish. Arch Linux wiki has details about how
to automount partitions on start-up. Still, I had a tough time to find out what
exactly needs to be done to simulate the behavior of Ubuntu-like distribution on
the mounting of NTFS drives. I got a hint from Arch Linux Wiki about the Polkit
configuration setting, which can be used to allow a standard user to mount
partitions. Here is a solution that I found after a long search on various Arch
Linux Community pages.

You will need to install `ntfs-3g`, `polkit` and `udisks2` to use this code.
Please refer to [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Udisks).

I think when using Gentoo, you will also need to compile the support for the
NTFS file system in Kernel also. Please see
[here](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/NTFS).

Add the following code to `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/10-udisks2.rules` -

```vim
// Allow udisks2 to mount devices without authentication for users in the "wheel" group.
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if ((action.id:= "org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount-system" ||
        action.id:= "org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount") &&
        subject.isInGroup("wheel")) {
            return polkit.Result.YES;
        }
    }
);

polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
   if ((action.id:= "org.freedesktop.udisks.filesystem-mount-system-internal") &&
        subject.isInGroup("wheel")) {
            return polkit.Result.YES;
        }
    }
);
```

Now you will be able to mount NTFS partition without any problem. :)
