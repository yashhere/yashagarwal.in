Disqus is the most popular commenting system available in the market right now. While its free nature comes with downsides (_hint_ - you are the data!), its ease of setup and not having to maintain a self-hosted commenting solution makes it a compelling choice for small blogs like this one.

I have been using Disqus for the last 10 years across various static site generators, so it contains all of my previous comments. While migrating Disqus comments to a different URL scheme is a topic for another day, this article focuses on setting up Disqus in a Next.js blog.

We'll cover how to:

- Create a React component wrapper for Disqus
- Implement lazy loading when the component is in view
- Make Disqus respect theme toggling
- Resolve OKLCH color incompatibility issues

Without further ado, let's begin.

# Prerequisites

1. You should have a Next.js blog.
2. `next-themes` for handling the dark mode toggling.
3. `disqus-react` for providing Disqus script.
4. `react-intersection-observer` to implement lazy-loading.

# Getting Your Disqus Shortname

Before implementing the component, you'll need to:

1. Create a Disqus account at [disqus.com](https://disqus.com)
2. Register your site and get your shortname
3. Configure your site settings in the Disqus admin panel

# Install the required packages

```bash
npm install disqus-react next-themes react-intersection-observer
# OR
bun add disqus-react next-themes react-intersection-observer
```

# Setting up next-themes

Adapt the root layout to match the following snippet -

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes"

import "./globals.css"

interface RootLayoutProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
}

export default function RootLayout({ children }: RootLayoutProps) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider
          attribute="class"
          defaultTheme="system"
          enableSystem
          disableTransitionOnChange
        >
          {children}
        </ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Now add the following to the `globals.css` file:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@config '../tailwind.config.js';

@layer base {
  :root {
    --background: theme("colors.white");
    --foreground: theme("colors.slate.950");
  }

  .dark {
    --background: theme("colors.slate.950");
    --foreground: theme("colors.slate.50");
  }

  body {
    @apply bg-background text-foreground;
    transition:
      background-color 0.2s ease,
      color 0.2s ease;
  }
}
```

Key features of this setup:

- `suppressHydrationWarning`: Prevents hydration warnings when theme changes on client
- `attribute="class"`: Uses CSS classes for theme switching (`.dark` class)
- `defaultTheme="system"`: Respects user's system preference
- `enableSystem`: Allows automatic system theme detection
- `disableTransitionOnChange`: Prevents flash during theme transitions

Since I use TailwindCSS v4, the `globals.css` might look a bit different. Another important thing to note is the use of syntax like `theme("colors.slate.950")` for setting the colors. This doesn't play nice with Disqus. We will see how to fix it later.

# Disqus Component

```tsx
"use client"

import React from "react"
import { DiscussionEmbed } from "disqus-react"
import { useTheme } from "next-themes"
import { useInView } from "react-intersection-observer"

interface CommentProps {
  url: string
  slug: string
}

export const DisqusComments = ({ url, slug }: CommentProps) => {
  const { resolvedTheme = "light" } = useTheme()
  const { ref, inView } = useInView({
    threshold: 0,
    triggerOnce: true,
    fallbackInView: true,
  })

  const disqusShortname = "your-disqus-shortname-here"

  const disqusConfig = {
    identifier: slug,
    url: url,
  }

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      {inView ? (
        <div className="comments">
          <DiscussionEmbed
            key={resolvedTheme}
            shortname={disqusShortname}
            config={disqusConfig}
          />
        </div>
      ) : null}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Key Features of this component are -

1. **Lazy Loading with Intersection Observer**

   The component uses `react-intersection-observer` to implement lazy loading:

   - Comments only load when the user scrolls to the comments section.
   - `threshold: 0` triggers loading as soon as the element enters the viewport.
   - `triggerOnce: true` ensures the component only loads once.
   - `fallbackInView: true` provides a fallback for environments where IntersectionObserver isn't available.

2. **Theme-Aware Rendering**

   The most crucial aspect for dark mode support is the `key={resolvedTheme}` prop on the `DiscussionEmbed` component. This forces React to completely remount the Disqus embed whenever the theme changes, ensuring proper color adaptation.

# Using the Disqus component

The component is used in the blog note page `app/notes/[slug]/page.tsx` (such as this one):

```tsx
<DisqusComments
  slug={params.slug}
  url={`${siteConfig.url}/notes/${params.slug}`}
/>
```

The URL construction ensures each post has a unique identifier for Disqus threads, while the slug provides a fallback identifier.

# Fixing OKLCH Color Incompatibility

Modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS v4 use [OKLCH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch) colors for better color accuracy and perceptual uniformity. However, Disqus's embedded iframe doesn't understand OKLCH color values.

When OKLCH colors are used, you'll encounter this error in the browser console:

```js
Uncaught Error: parseColor received unparseable color: oklch(000)
```

![`parseColor` Error](/images/notes/setting-up-disqus-in-nextjs-blog/parseColor-error.jpg "parseColor error in console")

This happens because Disqus validates color values and expects them to be in RGB or Hex format.

![Disqus code checks for RGB/Hex](/images/notes/setting-up-disqus-in-nextjs-blog/disqus-code-ref.jpg "Disqus code checks for RGB/Hex")

## The Solution

Override OKLCH colors with Hex equivalents specifically for the Disqus container:

```css
/* Fix for https://github.com/disqus/disqus-react/issues/153 */
:root,
.comments {
  background-color: #ffffff !important; /* white */
  color: #0f172a !important; /* slate-950 */
}

/* Dark mode comments - using hex values */
:root,
.dark .comments {
  background-color: #020617 !important; /* slate-950 */
  color: #f8fafc !important; /* slate-50 */
}
```

# Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Comments only load when visible, reducing initial page load time.
- **Theme Remounting**: While remounting on theme change might seem expensive, it's necessary for proper theme switching and happens infrequently.
- **CSS Optimization**: Color fixes are applied at the CSS level, avoiding JavaScript-based solutions that could impact performance.
