  A comprehensive guide to installing Arch Linux from scratch, covering network
  setup, disk partitioning, and base system installation.
---

Arch Linux is a Linux distribution known for its not-so-beginner-friendly
command line installer, no ready-to-use system after installation and
requirement of above average knowledge of command line. However, Arch Linux
allows me to set up a system in my desired state in shortest possible time with
least effort. This is why I keep coming back to Arch Linux even after some of
its annoyances.

This guide is written primarily for my reference, as someone who has installed
Arch Linux several times, I still can't remember all the installation steps
perfectly. Most of the steps have been taken from
[Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide) and should
work on other setups also.

All the commands are run in root shell unless otherwise specified.

# 0. Check your network connection

If you are behind a captive portal, use `links` to open browser and login into
your network. For WiFi connections, use `wifi-menu`. LAN connections should not
require any setup. The boot environment should automatically detect any wired
connections. After connecting, test your connection by pinging any website:

```bash
ping -c 5 google.com
```

# 1. Setup SSH

This step is not mandatory, though I prefer to use this method to install Arch
Linux, as it provides me the convenience of copying and pasting the commands
directly from Arch wiki.

By default the Arch Linux `root` account password is empty. We need to set up a
password for `root` account, which is needed for an SSH connection.

```bash
passwd
```

Now we need to change the setting to permit `root` login via SSH in
`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Check that `PermitRootLogin yes` is uncommented in this
file. If this line is not present there, add this to the end. Now start the
`sshd.service` by issuing the command

```bash
sudo systemctl start sshd.service
```

Also, note the IP address of the target machine by inspecting the output of the
following command.

```bash
ip addr
```

_Pro tip:_ One liner to get only the IP address

```bash
ip -o -4 addr show | awk -F '[ /]+' '/global/ {print $4}'
```

Now on your host machine, connect to the target machine via SSH using the
following command

```bash
ssh root@ip-address-of-target
```

# 2. Partition the disks

If Windows 8 or above is already installed on your machine, then your hard disk
is probably using `GPT` partitioning scheme. In that case, use `gdisk` to
partition your hard disk. ~~If you use `fdisk` on a GPT partitioned HDD, there
is a possibility of data loss.~~ `fdisk` understands `GPT` partitioning scheme
also.[1]

My preferred setup is to have one root partition and one home partition and use
`EFI` partition created by Windows to install boot-loader. The root and home
partition will be formatted using `ext4` file-system and the `EFI` partition
should be formatted using `FAT32` file-system.

For this guide, I am assuming that the `EFI` partition is `sda1`, root partition
is `sda9` and home partition is `sda10`.

Now to format the partitions with `ext4` file-system:

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda9
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda10
```

# 3. Mount the partitions

Now mount the root partition (`sda9` in this case) to `/mnt`

```bash
mount /dev/sda9 /mnt
```

If you have created any other partitions in previous steps, mount them at
appropriate locations.

```bash
mkdir /mnt/home
mount /dev/sda10 /mnt/home

mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
```

# 4. Install the base file-system

To install the base system and some development tools, issue the following
command.

```bash
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel
```

This will take a while to download and install. After it finishes, it will give
you a bare-bone Arch Linux system with just the tools required to run a Linux
distribution, no other software is installed.

# 5. Generate /etc/fstab

The `/etc/fstab` file stores the information about file systems of partitions
and how to mount the partitions on system boot up. To generate this file, issue
the following command:

```bash
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

If you prefer to use partition labels (sda1, sda9 etc.) instead of UUID, then
use `-L` flag in place of `-U`.

# 6. chroot into the system

From the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Change_root):

> Chroot is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the
> current running process and their children. A program that is run in such a
> modified environment cannot access files and commands outside that
> environmental directory tree. This modified environment is called a chroot
> jail.

At this step, we will go to the root of the newly installed system at `/mnt` and
pretend as if we are logged into this system.

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
```

# 7. Setup the time zone, locale, and hostname

Browse the `/use/share/zoneinfo` directory to find your location entries. My
location is India, so I will use this command.

```bash
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime
```

To set the hardware clock:

```bash
hwclock --systohc
```

To set the locale for your system, open the `/etc/locale.gen` file and uncomment
your language. or run the following command for the default `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8`.

```bash
LANG=C perl -i -pe 's/#(en_US.UTF)/$1/' /etc/locale.gen
```

Now generate the localization with

```bash
locale-gen
```

Then set the `LANG` variable in `/etc/locale.conf` accordingly, or run the
following command:

```bash
localectl set-locale LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
```

To set the hostname for your machine:

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname your-host-name
```

To allow other machines to address the host by name, it is necessary to edit the
`/etc/hosts` file to look like this:

```bash
127.0.0.1    localhost.localdomain          localhost
::1          localhost.localdomain          localhost
127.0.1.1    your-host-name.localdomain     your-host-name
```

# 8. Create user account

Before creating user account, set password for `root` account

```bash
passwd
```

Now create a local account for your user

```bash
useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash your-user-name
```

This will set up your user account, create a home directory for your user, set
the default shell to `bash` and add your user to `wheel` group, which is
necessary to gain `sudo` access in later steps.

Set password for your user.

```bash
passwd your-user-name
```

# 9. Enable sudo access

This allows you to use root privileges without using the root account. To enable
this, first open `/etc/sudoers` file

```bash
nano /etc/sudoers
```

Now uncomment the following line to enable `root` privilege for all the users
inside `wheel` group:

```bash
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

Now you can safely disable root account

```bash
passwd -l root

# login into your user account
su your-user-name
```

From this point onwards, it is necessary to append `sudo` to any command that
requires `root` privileges.

# 10. Install bootloader

My preferred bootloader of choice is `grub`. To install `grub`, we need to
install following packages.

```bash
sudo pacman -S grub efibootmgr
```

Now install `grub` with the following command.

```bash
sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=arch
```

Here `--efi-directory` is the folder where the `EFI` partition is mounted
[step 3](#step3) and `--bootloader-id` is the label that will appear in your
UEFI boot menu entry.

This particular step is specific to my machine's hardware, you might not need to
run this step. I need to add `pci=nommconf` to my kernel boot parameters in
`/etc/default/grub`, otherwise `tty` prints error messages continuously.

Now run to generate grub configuration file.

```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

If you encounter any errors related to `lvm` during installation of grub, then
follow these steps.

```bash
# come out of chroot
exit
mkdir /mnt/hostrun
mount --bind /run /mnt/hostrun

# back to chroot
arch-chroot /mnt
mkdir /run/lvm
mount --bind /hostrun/lvm /run/lvm
```

Now you can install `grub` without any errors.

# 11. Configure the network

By default, your current system cannot connect to the network in the current
state. I prefer to use
[NetworkManager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager) for my
network management, even when I am not using GNOME. For wireless networking,
install the following additional packages.

```bash
sudo pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant dialog networkmanager network-manager-applet dhclient
```

`NetworkManager` supports basic DHCP configuration. For full support, I have
installed `dhclient`. `NetworkManager` also supports automatic wired connection
detection and comes with curses based tool `nmtui` to setup wireless connection.

To enable NetworkManager to start at system startup

```bash
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager.service
```

# 12. Reboot now

If you had performed the `lvm` troubleshooting steps during `grub` install, then

```bash
umount /run/lvm
```

Now exit from `chroot` by typing `exit` in the shell. Unmount all the mounted
partitions with:

```bash
umount -R /mnt
```

Finally, reboot your machine by typing `reboot` and remove the installation USB
drive. If you are not able to boot into your system at this point, boot from the
installation media again and attempt to fix the installation.

If you can see a terminal with a prompt for your username, congratulations! You
have completed the first step towards building your own system.

I will be writing about making your system usable and stable in the
[second](/notes/arch-linux-installation-guide-part-2/) part of this guide.

Hope you enjoyed the post. Stay tuned :)
