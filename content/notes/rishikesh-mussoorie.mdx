description: Read about a long awaited trip to Rishikesh and Mussoorie

Our last trip was in June 2023. Various factors, including my hectic work schedule, prevented us from planning another trip for nearly a year. While my spouse patiently waited, her patience eventually ran out. So, we mutually agreed to put everything aside and embark on a new adventure. After failing to agree upon anything, we decided to explore Rishikesh and Mussoorie. June is probably not a good time to visit Rishikesh, but the ease of travel trumped every other issue.

# Weather

While June is not considered a good time to visit Rishikesh, it is an excellent time to visit Mussoorie. Rishikesh is hot and humid in June. We felt that immediately after deboarding our bus. But we acclimatized quite well, perhaps because we are already used to this kind of climate in Jaipur. Also, renting a bike (more on it later) did help quite a bit as we didn’t have to roam around looking for transportation. I should however mention that we were completely tanned at the end of this trip, so it was not all rosy.

Mussoorie’s weather was almost the opposite. It was pleasantly cool and it was a huge relief for us after Rishikesh. Although mornings and evenings were quite pleasant, the afternoons were slightly on the hotter side. It rained heavily during our last night in Mussoorie. Momentarily it brought back the memories of reading news about heavy rains lashing Uttarakhand in June and the troubles it causes. Fortunately, it was a one-off incident, and we were able to leave Mussoorie the next day without any issues.

# Rishikesh

## Bus to Rishikesh

Typically, I prefer traveling by train, but on this particular route (or to Haridwar), trains are consistently full. Given the lack of alternative options, we were compelled to choose the bus as our mode of transportation. While I have previously had negative experiences with bus travel, it has significantly improved in recent years. Direct overnight buses operate between Jaipur and Rishikesh. The journey typically takes around 12 hours. We arrived in Rishikesh at approximately 8:30 AM. The bus ride was satisfactory, and we were grateful to have avoided any issues during the night journey.

## Nepali Farm to Tapovan

The buses traveling to Rishikesh drop passengers at Nepali Farm Flyover, situated approximately 19 km from Tapovan, a happening place in Rishikesh known for its quality hotels. Shared ferries are available from Nepali Farm to Tapovan. These ferries typically charge ₹100 per person. Bargaining is generally ineffective if there are other individuals waiting for the ferry.

## The hotel - ArtBuzz

We booked ArtBuzz through Goibibo. The booking experience was largely seamless. To ensure peace of mind, I directly sent an email to the hotel to confirm the reservation, as some people on the Internet have shared unpleasant experiences with travel sites like Goibibo. It is generally a good idea to confirm your booking directly with the hotel, to avoid any potential issues during check-in.

ArtBuzz was inaugurated just a month back so most of the amenities were fresh and modern. While the hotel’s location is not too far from tourist attractions, reaching the main road requires an uphill walk. Fortunately, bike rentals are widely available in Rishikesh, making it convenient to explore the city hassle-free.

## Bike Rental

Exploring Rishikesh's various tourist attractions is best done by renting a scooty. Most attractions are beyond the city limits, and relying on ferries and autos can be costly as vendors often charge inflated prices. We rented a Honda Activa 5G for three days at a total cost of ₹1400. Helmets are included, though surprisingly, Rishikesh does not require pillion riders to wear them. To meet our travel needs, we filled the petrol tank with approximately 2 liters of petrol.

## Places to see

1. Ram Jhula
   A suspension bridge for pedestrians to cross the holy Ganga. It is almost always crowded. Nothing too special about it.

2. Parmarth Niketan
   We didn’t go inside the Ashram but we attended the Ganga Arati on our first day in Rishikesh. Fortunately, we arrived at the Ghat right at the time of gate opening, securing front-row seats. Notably, there were separate seating arrangements for a select few, likely those who contributed financially to the Arati. While the ambiance was enjoyable, it was evident that the event had become heavily commercialized, with drone cameras capturing footage and live streaming on Youtube.

3. Janaki Setu
   Yet another bridge. This time, allowing vehicles to cross the Ganga.

4. Triveni Ghat
   We were so mesmerized by this place that we visited it twice in two days. Although it is also a commercialized event, there is still enough for common people here. The environment during the kirtan after the Ganga Arati was highly electrical and amazing. Those who opt to pay for Arati get to attend a personalized pooja done right beside the Ganga by a priest. Throughout the evening, Bhajans fill the air, adding to the spiritual ambiance. The Ganga Arati in itself is a mesmerizing spectacle. We thoroughly enjoyed this place.

5. 13 Manzil Temple
   A place that must be avoided at all costs. It is a highly commercialized complex building with many shops. There are several floors (apparently 13, I lost my count midway) in this building. All the floors have a sequence of shops. Some shops are occupied by the vendors selling various items. Some other shops are occupied by idols of various Hindu gods. Visiting this temple made me realize the absolute abundance of gods in Hinduism and how irrelevant many minor gods are for the majority of the Hindus. Anyway, the purpose of this “temple” building appears to be business. I couldn’t feel any spirituality after visiting this building.

6. Bhootnath temple
   Another “probably” is a newly constructed temple on top of an ancient temple. From the look of the actual Shivling on the top floor of the temple, I am not sure if the Shivling has any ancient significance. In any case, the view from here is good. We visited in the afternoon so it was very hot.

7. Neer Garh Waterfall
   A crowded and over-hyped place.

8. Bhatta Waterfall
   A man-made crowded waterfall and adventure park.

9. Rafting
   Rishikesh is renowned for its exhilarating rafting activities. It certainly lived up to its reputation in my experience as well. Our expectations were high, especially since both of us had backed out of Bungee Jumping at the last moment. We had rafted on the Sutlej river in Kullu last year, however, rafting on the Ganga was a totally different experience. The instructor even allowed us to take a dive in the Ganga. This adventure was undoubtedly exceptional and I highly recommend it. For a rafting distance of 12 kilometers, it cost us ₹820 each, which was unquestionably worth every rupee spent.
