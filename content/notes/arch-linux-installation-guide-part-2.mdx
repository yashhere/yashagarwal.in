In this post, I will continue from my last
[post](/notes/arch-linux-installation-guide-part-1/) and set up my newly installed Arch
Linux for daily use. I am going to install some applications that I use on a day
to day basis. Some of these applications are required for my current dotfile
[configuration](/notes/my-own-configuration-manager/) setup to work properly. The
choice of applications is highly opinionated and your preferences might be
different.

If you had gone for installation via SSH option, then I would suggest you to
edit your `sshd_config` file and disable `root` login. It can be a security risk
otherwise.

# Install a terminal based browser

Terminal-based browsers are very handy in cases when you are required to login
into a captive portal and you don't have access to a graphical browser. We will
install two different browsers, `elinks` and `w3m`.

```bash
sudo pacman -S elinks w3m
```

# Install X server.

```bash
sudo pacman -S xorg
```

This will install minimal X desktop environment with fonts, in case, you want to
test your system before installing any desktop environment.

# Enable multilib repository for 32-bit package support

To enable multilib repository, uncomment the `[multilib]` section in
`/etc/pacman.conf`.

```bash
[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

Now upgrade your system.

```bash
sudo pacman -Syyu
```

# Install video and touchpad drivers

```bash
sudo pacman -S xf86-video-intel xf86-input-synaptics
```

# Install pacaur to fetch and install packages from AUR

```bash
sudo pacman -S expac yajl --noconfirm
cd /tmp
gpg --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu:80 1EB2638FF56C0C53
curl -o PKGBUILD https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/plain/PKGBUILD?h=cower
makepkg -i PKGBUILD --noconfirm
curl -o PKGBUILD https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/plain/PKGBUILD?h=pacaur
makepkg -i PKGBUILD --noconfirm
cd
```

# Install graphical browsers

```bash
pacaur -S firefox chromium
```

# Install code editors

```bash
pacaur -S sublime-text-dev atom-editor-git visual-studio-code-bin neovim neovim-drop-in leafpad
```

# Setup LAMP stack

## Install Apache server

```bash
sudo pacman -S apache

# Make your user-directory available to apache server
mkdir ~/public_html
chmod o+x ~
chmod o+x ~/public_html
chmod -R o+r ~/public_html
```

```bash
# To enable virtualhosts, uncomment the following line in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`
Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
```

Add your virtualhost configuration in following file -

```bash
sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
```

To test the virtual hosts on you local machine, add the virtual names to your
`/etc/hosts` file.

## Install PHP

```bash
sudo pacman -S php php-apache
```

To use PHP with apache, open `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` and uncomment
following line -

```bash
LoadModule mpm_prefork_module modules/mod_mpm_prefork.so
```

and comment out the following line -

```bash
# LoadModule mpm_event_module modules/mod_mpm_event.so
```

Now add these lines to `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`:

```bash
# Add these at the end of `LoadModule` section.
LoadModule php7_module modules/libphp7.so
AddHandler php7-script .php

# Place this at the end of the `Include` section:
Include conf/extra/php7_module.conf
```

## Install MySQL server

```bash
sudo pacman -S mariadb

# Initialize the MariaDB data directory prior to starting the service. To do so, run:
sudo mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql

# Then issue the commands to start the database server
sudo systemctl enable mariadb.service
sudo systemctl start mariadb.service

# To apply recommended security settings to your database, run
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

## Install PHPMyAdmin

```bash
sudo pacman -S phpmyadmin php-mcrypt
```

Enable `mysqli`, `mcrypt`, `zip` and `bz2` extensions in `/etc/php/php.ini`.

Create the apache configuration file `/etc/httpd/conf/extra/phpmyadmin.conf`

```apache
Alias /phpmyadmin "/usr/share/webapps/phpMyAdmin"
<Directory "/usr/share/webapps/phpMyAdmin">
    DirectoryIndex index.php
    AllowOverride All
    Options FollowSymlinks
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

Then include following in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`

```apache
# phpMyAdmin configuration
Include conf/extra/phpmyadmin.conf
```

Now restart `httpd` service to apply settings.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

Once all these steps are done, your LAMP stack should be working.

# Setup power management

Install `tlp` and some of its optional dependencies

```bash
sudo pacman -S tlp tlp-rdw bash-completion ethtool lsb-release smartmontools
```

Then enable `tlp` services

```bash
sudo systemctl enable tlp.service
sudo systemctl enable tlp-sleep.service

# mask some services for tlp to work properly
sudo systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.service
sudo systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.socket
```

# Install i3 and other tools

All these tools are part of my `i3` config with exception of the theme related
packages. So installing them here will help me later while setting up the `i3`
window manager.

```bash
pacaur -S i3 rofi polybar xautolock powerline-fonts-git i3lock-fancy-git compton scrot feh dunst unclutter xfce4-power-manager numlockx lxappearance adapta-gtk-theme gtk-engine-murrine gnome-themes-standard termite
```

# Fix Ugly Fonts [^1]

Fonts rendering is one area where Linux still lags behind Windows and OSX. It
can be a nightmare for users to setup fonts properly in Linux. In Arch Linux,
this is even worse. I found some tricks to improve the quality of font rendering
on Arch Linux. Though this is far from perfect, it is manageable. Follow these
[steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/5r5ep8/make_your_arch_fonts_beautiful_easily/)
on Reddit to fix font rendering. I use Noto Sans, Adobe Source Code Pro, and
Microsoft fonts. My apologies, but I can't help here. Some websites still use
Microsoft fonts.

# Setup Python Environment

I use Python extensively and virtual environments are a must for my development
setup. I use `pipenv` to manage my virtual environments. To install `pipenv`,
you need to install `virtualenv` first. To install it, run the following
command.

```bash
sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv
```

Now you are ready to install `pipenv`. Follow
[here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to install the tool.

# Install some other common tools

```bash
sudo pacman -S vlc openssh npm imagemagick git la-capitaine-icon-theme-git
```

Do not forget to
[setup](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10081293/install-npm-into-home-directory-with-distribution-nodejs-package-ubuntu/13021677#13021677)
`npm` to install packages globally without requiring `sudo`.

That's all! Your system should be in working condition now. Do check out my
[dotfiles](/notes/my-own-configuration-manager/) if you want to set up your
system like mine.

Hope you enjoyed the article. Cheers ðŸ˜„
