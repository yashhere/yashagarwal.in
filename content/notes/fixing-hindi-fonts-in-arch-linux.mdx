When viewing Hindi content in any browser in Arch Linux, the rendering looks
weird.

It doesn't look good, right! I'll try to fix this issue in this post. You might
need to install the appropriate
[font support](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/fonts) in Arch Linux before
applying this fix. The suitable package for installing Indic Language support is
`ttf-indic-otf`.

Now go to `/usr/share/fonts/TTF` and take the backup of two fonts `FreeSans.ttf`
and `FreeSerif.ttf`. Now delete these two fonts from the directory. Restart the
browser and see the difference.

This bug is reported in
[this](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser/+bug/856736)
bug report in 2011. I don't know why nobody has fixed it yet. Or maybe I was not
able to find the proper solution. This workaround is also given in the same bug
report.

I hope this helps. :)
