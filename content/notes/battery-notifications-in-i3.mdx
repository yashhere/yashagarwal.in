I am using _i3_ window manager for the last seven months, and it has been a
pleasant and productive experience so far. There were a few hiccups here and
there, but that is expected with such minimalistic setups. One thing that I
never noticed was the lack of notifications on critical battery levels. For the
last few months, my laptop battery was discharging to 0% all the time. Probably
this proved to be too fatal for my battery. According to this
[article](https://lifehacker.com/how-often-should-i-charge-my-gadgets-battery-to-prolong-5875162),
lithium-ion batteries are not expected to go from 100% to 0% frequently. I
recently bought a new battery, and I did not want to reduce the lifespan of this
battery too. So I decided to set up battery notifications for my i3 setup.

I [found](https://angelos.dev/2016/06/low-battery-notification-in-i3wm/) a bash
script which shows a notification using _notify-send_ when battery charge level
reaches or drops below a configured threshold. However, I had to do some
additional steps to make this script work on my system.

The first issue was the _lockfile_ program, which was not installed in my
system. I installed it using the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install procmail
```

The second issue was more difficult to solve. I planned to set up the script to
run every minute using _cron_. However, it turns out that cron operates in a
very
[minimalistic](https://askubuntu.com/questions/23009/why-crontab-scripts-are-not-working/23438#23438)
environment and notify-send requires the presence of some special variables in
the environment. These variables are **DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS**,
**XAUTHORITY** and **DISPLAY**. To provide the values of these variables to the
cron environment, I modified the script and sourced a new file `.bat_envs`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

. /home/yash/.bat_envs

THRESHOLD=15

lock_path='/tmp/battery.lock'

lockfile -r 0 $lock_path 2>/dev/null || exit

acpi_path=$(find /sys/class/power_supply/ -name 'BAT*' | head -1)
charge_now=$(cat "$acpi_path/charge_now")
charge_full=$(cat "$acpi_path/charge_full")
charge_status=$(cat "$acpi_path/status")
charge_percent=$(printf '%.0f' $(echo "$charge_now / $charge_full * 100"
 | bc -l))
message="Battery running critically low at $charge_percent%!"

if [[ $charge_status == 'Discharging' ]] && [[ $charge_percent -le $THRE
SHOLD ]]; then
  /usr/bin/notify-send -u critical "Low battery" "$message"

  current_date_time="`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`";
  echo "[BATTERY LOG] = $charge_percent% on $current_date_time"
fi

rm -f $lock_path
```

Read this blog
[post](https://angelos.dev/2016/06/low-battery-notification-in-i3wm/) to
understand how this script works.

As the notify-send requires some special X session environmental variables, we
will need a method to provide these variables to notify-send in cron
environment. The safest way to get X session related environmental variables is
to get them from the environment of a process of the user who is logged on to X.
The following script will run every time a user logs in and stores these
variables in a file `.bat_envs`.

{/* https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/111194 */}

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

env_path="$HOME/.bat_envs"

rm -f "${env_path}"
touch "${env_path}"

copy_envs="XAUTHORITY DISPLAY DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS"

for env_name in $copy_envs
do
    env | grep "${env_name}" >> "${env_path}";
    echo "export ${env_name}" >> "${env_path}";
done

chmod 600 "${env_path}"
```

To run this script at startup, I added this file to the i3 config file with the
following command.

```bash
exec --no-startup-id "path to your script"
```

Then at the end of cron file, I added a new entry for the battery monitoring
script.

To open cron file:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Now add the following line to the end of the file and save the file.

```bash
* * * * * bash "path to your script" >> "path to your log file"
```

Replace the _path to your script_ (with double quotes) with your script path and
the _path to your log file_ with a path where you want to save your log file.

Now every minute, this script will be executed, and if your battery percent
drops below the threshold value, you will be notified with a notification
bubble.

I tested this procedure on _Ubuntu 18.04 with i3_. It should work on Arch Linux
and other non-Debian distributions also, but the steps might be slightly
different due to various reasons. Please comment if you face any issues with the
setup.

Thank you for reading the article. Cheers ðŸ˜„
