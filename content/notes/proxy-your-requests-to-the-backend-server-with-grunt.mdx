If you are working on large projects, it is undoubtedly a good idea to have a
build script or some task scripts to help to automate some of the repetitive
parts of the development process. For JavaScript projects, `Grunt` serves a
similar purpose. It is a JavaScript task/build runner that is written on top of
NodeJS. Grunt can help you with automatically minifying your JavaScript or CSS
files, or reload your browser on every file change. It can show you a
comprehensive list of JavaScript errors, compile your `SASS/LESS` files into CSS
files automatically, and many other things.

However, the most significant advantage of Grunt that I am going to discuss
today is its ability to proxy your requests. For example, when you are
developing your backend with anything other than JavaScript, you will face
difficulty in accessing the backend data in your frontend without having to
compile and deploy the code every time you make any changes. It is not possible
with a typical web server setup because
[XHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest) requests are not allowed to
be cross-domain by browsers due to
[Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
(CORS) limitations.

So, the problem here is as follows,

> you are developing the UI of your applications using some frontend JavaScript
> framework (say Angular) with Grunt as the build runner, and the backend of
> your application is being designed in some backend framework other than
> JavaScript/NodeJS (say Laravel), you might face problems accessing the backend
> while running Grunt server.

It happens because the backend Laravel service runs on port 8000, and the front
end development server runs on port 8080. The requests from the frontend server
to the backend-server will result in
[same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)
errors due to the port difference. To fix this issue, we can set up CORS through
a proxy on Grunt. This proxy will stand in front of your frontend server and the
backend server and get the required data from the backend and pass it to your
frontend while letting your browser think that you are all in the same domain.

Grunt has a module
[grunt-connect-proxy](https://github.com/drewzboto/grunt-connect-proxy) that
exists to help to solve this issue. It delegates requests that match a given URL
to the backend of your choice. So for example, you want to access your backend
using the URL `http://localhost:8080/api`, you can write a proxy rule so that
whenever your user tries to access this URL in a browser, the proxy will get the
data from your backend and server it at this particular URL.

The procedure to set up the proxy is simple. First, you will have to add the
proxy configuration to your `Gruntfile.js`. In this example, I am assuming that
the backend server is running on the port 8000, and the Grunt server is running
on the port 8080. This configuration will delegate all requests to
`http://localhost:8080/api` to `http://localhost:8000/backend`.

```js
connect: {
  server: {
    options: {
      port: 8080,
      base: 'public',
      hostname: 'localhost',
      livereload: true,
      middleware: function (connect, options, middlewares) {
        middlewares.unshift(require('grunt-connect-proxy/lib/utils').proxyRequest);
        return middlewares;
      }
    },
    proxies: [
      {
        context: '/api',
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 8000,
        https: false,
        rewrite: {
            '^/api': '/backend'
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Now register your Grunt server task to run the proxy on Grunt execution.

```js
grunt.registerTask("server", function (target) {
  grunt.task.run(["configureProxies:server", "connect:server"])
})
```

Let me explain the above two scripts line by line. In the connect section of
your `Gruntfile`, we add a new section called `proxies`. The options defined in
the proxies section are explained below.

- **context**: This is the context against which the incoming requests will be
  matched. Matching requests will be proxied to the backend server.
- **host**: The host address where the backend server is running. The incoming
  requests will be proxied to this host.
- **port**: The port where the backend server is running.
- **https**: If your backend server is an https endpoint, then set this value to
  `true`.
- **rewrite**: This option allows rewriting of URL when proxying. What this
  means is that when trying to proxy `http://localhost:8080/api` to the backend
  server, the URL will be rewritten as `http://localhost:8000/backend`. The
  object's key serves as the regex used in the replacement operation, and the
  object's value is the context of your backend server's service.

More options can be found in the
[documentation](https://github.com/drewzboto/grunt-connect-proxy#grunt-connect-proxy)
of `grunt-connect-proxy`.

You will also need to set up the proxy's middleware in the `options` section of
the `connect`. The relevant code is as follows.

```js
...
middleware: function (connect, options, middlewares) {
  middlewares.unshift(require('grunt-connect-proxy/lib/utils').proxyRequest);
  return middlewares;
}
...
```

Finally, include your proxy task in the server task. It is necessary to append
the proxy task before the connect task. Also, make sure to specify the
connection target in the `configureProxies` section. In our case, the connect
target is `server`.

Now you can start your Grunt server via this configured proxy by typing
`Grunt server` in the command line. You should see something like this in the
console.

```bash
$ grunt server
...
Running "configureProxies:server" (configureProxies) task
Rewrite rule created for: [/^\/api/ -> /backend].
Proxy created for: /api to localhost:8000

Running "connect:server" (connect) task
Started connect web server on http://localhost:8080
...
```

The above output confirms that the proxy is working fine. Some of the example
URLs are:

1. `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api` points to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/backend`
2. `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/x/y` points to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/backend/x/y`

That's all. Now you will not face any problems getting data from any backend of
your choice.
