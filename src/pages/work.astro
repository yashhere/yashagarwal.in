        <p>
          I am an enthusiastic software developer with a knack for backend development. I've got my
          hands dirty in Python, Golang, and C++. I have mainly worked in cybersecurity domain in my
          career including things like web-application penetration testing and writing code for both
          POCs and highly scalable commercial security products.

          What sets me apart? I am not just about what's already in the toolkit. A relentless
          commitment to continuous learning and adaptability. I am always ready to dive into the
          latest, adapt and turn challenges into victory.
