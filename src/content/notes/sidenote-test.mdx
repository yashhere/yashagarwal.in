# Introduction to Sidenotes

This is a standard paragraph to test the flow of text. It should look completely normal and span the full width of the content column.

Here is a paragraph that contains a sidenote.<Sidenote title="Look at me!">This is a sidenote that should appear in the right margin on desktop, but as a collapsible detail on mobile.</Sidenote> Ideally, the <Sidenote title="Look at me again!">sidenote</Sidenote> should align vertically with the text where it was declared.

## Another Section

Let's try another one here. <Sidenote>This one has no title, so it should just show the content.</Sidenote> It is important to verify that multiple sidenotes do not overlap if they are close to each other, although our absolute positioning might cause overlap if paragraphs are short.
