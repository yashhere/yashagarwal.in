  The author shares the surprising journey to engagement, reflecting on new
  emotions and the personal reasons behind this life-changing decision.

Life sometimes takes such unexpected turns that we humans can only stand still
and wonder. That's what happened to me. Just two months back, I was urging my
father to stop talking to me about my marriage plans, and here I am today,
announcing my engagement. It is how the sequence of events has been in my life
in the last two months. However, I am not at all troubled with all these sudden
turns and twists.

Coming to the topic of the discussion, the name of my fiancée is Vishakha. Our
roka-cum-engagement ceremony took place on 30th of July. We exchanged rings
before a small family gathering and had our first pooja together. Now, we are
officially in our courtship period. We both belong to slightly different
educational backgrounds and academic interests. However, that doesn't seem to be
a barrier between us, and we share many views about life, family, society, and
other things in general.

I have been timid in talking to strangers, but right from our first meeting, I
struck a strange connection with her. Our first meeting lasted for around one
and a half hours, which astonished our families, given that she and I don't talk
much, even among family members. Since then, we have spoken for uncountable
hours, discussing our priorities, ambitions, goals, thoughts about life, likes,
dislikes, etc.

It may be initial excitement or infatuation, but I can feel the emotions of care
and love blossoming in me. These are some unfamiliar emotions for me. I have
never attached to any human being other than my parents. Now having the same
feelings for a stranger is difficult to digest. I don't know if love can blossom
so quickly. But if it does, then I am definitely in love. And if it doesn't, it
will happen soon.

When I broke the news on Instagram, many people asked me one question - Why so
early? While there were no particular reasons behind my decision, in retrospect,
I think this was an excellent decision to take at this juncture of my life.

1. I am currently stagnating in my life and career. I am going through that
   phase where I don't see any yield of my work on both personal and
   professional fronts. Although I am confident that I will reap the results of
   this work in the future, the present appears to be the best time to welcome
   another person into my life. I hope her entry into my life and the resultant
   influence will help me come out of this slump phase. I must mention that this
   is a double-edged sword, and I am taking a huge risk here. But that is
   something only time will tell.
2. My parents would have started forcing me to get married in the next year or
   two. I preferred not to juggle between Bengaluru (or elsewhere) and Jaipur,
   hoping to find a match. I have seen my cousins struggling with that.
3. I had planned to go for a corporate-sponsored graduate program. But then I
   left Cisco, and since Netskope doesn't have any such program; I had to put
   this plan on hold for a couple of years. So, I am relatively free at this
   point in my life. I believe there couldn't have been a better time to hook up
   than this.
4. After the pandemic began, I came back to my hometown. Since then, my life has
   become highly monotonous, and I was looking for some respite from it. I was
   feeling the need for another person in my life who could push me out of my
   comfort zone while also respecting my boundaries.
5. Perhaps I was also looking for lady luck.

Marrying means leaving your bachelorhood behind, and that has its downsides.

1. Time spent on your family means you can't spend time on your career and other
   outside-of-work activities. But I think, at some point, I had to find a
   balance anyway.
2. The responsibility to maintain a family is not an easy one. It comes with its
   challenges. Bachelorhood is relatively easy; you are on your own. But in
   married life, someone else is looking up to you for constant support,
   dedication, and love. I wonder how long it will take me to adjust to this.
3. Your goals and ambitions are not only yours anymore. They get shared with
   your spouse. And if the spouse is not supportive, life can take a downturn
   quickly.
4. You can't just think about yourself selfishly. You need to consider the
   effect of every decision of yours on your spouse as well. It can get clumsy
   sometimes.

As usual, I have spoiled this post by talking about ups and downs 🤣. My habit
of weighing everything in pros and cons will not die so quickly 🤓. But I want
to clarify one thing: I am thrilled and content with my decision.

I am looking forward to this alliance and spending more time getting to know
Vishi 💗. I hope I will be a worthy partner to her.
